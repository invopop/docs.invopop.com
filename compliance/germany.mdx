## Executive summary

Germany distinguishes clearly between B2G and B2B electronic invoicing. For B2G, the **XRechnung** format—based on **EN 16931** and implemented in **UBL** or **CII** syntax—has been mandatory since November 2020 for all invoices to public authorities, typically exchanged via the **Peppol network**.

For B2B, businesses must be able to receive structured e-invoices compliant with EN 16931, while issuing such invoices will become mandatory from Jan 2027 for companies with turnover above €800.000, and from January 2028 for all businesses in domestic B2B transactions. **ZUGFeRD**, a hybrid PDF + XML format aligned with EN 16931 and equivalent to France’s Factur-X, is accepted alongside XRechnung.

Germany is preparing for EU-wide Digital Reporting Requirements (ViDA), expected around 2030, which will introduce VAT e-reporting requirements based on EN 16931 data.

Structured invoices must be **archived in their original XML format** for **eight years**, in compliance with **GoBD** rules ensuring data integrity, readability, and domestic accessibility.

Invopop provides coverage for German invoicing through the **OASIS UBL** and **ZUGFeRD** apps, supporting both XRechnung and ZUGFeRD formats. The platform also offers integrations with Stripe and Chargebee, enabling businesses to issue compliant invoices directly from their merchant or ERP platforms while automatically handling format compliance and Peppol network routing when required.

## Invoicing in Germany

Electronic invoicing is well established and regulated, with a clear distinction between B2G and B2B/B2C transactions. For B2G, the XRechnung format is mandatory for invoices to public authorities, and these are primarily exchanged via the Peppol network or authorized access points. B2B and B2C invoicing remain largely unregulated in format, though adoption of e-invoicing standards is increasing, especially for efficiency and integration with accounting systems.

Under the recently passed Wachstumschancengesetz (Growth Opportunities Act), Germany will implement a phased rollout for domestic B2B invoicing in structured electronic formats. For more information, check the ZUGFeRD section below.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="XRechnung (B2G)">
    XRechnung is Germany’s standard for e-invoices in public procurement (B2G, called E-Rechnungen), though it can also be used for B2B transactions. It’s part of the implementation of the EU directive 2014/55/EU, which requires all contracting authorities in the EU to accept electronic invoices in a structured XML file. It can be implemented using two different syntaxes, CII and UBL.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ZUGFeRD (B2B)">
    ZUGFeRD is a German standard for electronic invoicing designed to bridge the gap between traditional invoices and digital formats. ZUGFeRD combines a standard PDF/A-3 invoice with an embedded XML file containing the structured data. This hybrid approach is well suited for B2B transactions, as it allows both people and accounting software to work with the same document. It is fully aligned with the European Norm EN 16931. It is worth noting that ZUGFeRD and Factur-X are a joint project between Germany and France, and their content is identical.

## E-reporting

Germany is aligning with the EU's ViDA directive, which projects Digital Reporting Requirements (DRRs). Digital reporting obligation is likely around 2030 or later for Germany, though exact timelines and legal details are not yet fixed. The forthcoming reporting model would require EN 16931 compliant data enabling tax authorities to access invoice‑level data for VAT monitoring and fraud prevention.

## Regulation

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Archival requirements">
    In July 2025, the Ministry of Finance made public how structured e-invoices must be archived:

    * Only the XML must be archived (even if it's a ZUGFeRD hybrid) the embedded XML is the tax‑binding element. PDFs are optional if a readable view can be generated.
    * Invoices must be stored in the XML format received (CII or UBL), even if converted internally, to satisfy audit requirements.
    * Data generally must remain in Germany and must comply with GoBD.
    * Germany shortened the invoice archival period from 10 to 8 years.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Other requirements">
    Germany’s e‑invoicing compliance is strict and technical, especially around invoice content, format, and archiving:

    * Legally required invoice elements: seller/buyer tax IDs, invoice number, date, line‑item details, VAT breakdowns, and references to contracts or purchase orders if applicable. Missing or incorrect data can make an invoice legally invalid.
    * Structured formats: For B2G, this is XRechnung; for future B2B mandates, invoices will need to be EN 16931-compliant (XRechnung or ZUGFeRD). PDFs without an XML attachment are insufficient for mandated channels.
    * Archiving: All invoices, whether received or issued, must be retained digitally and unaltered for 8 years in a compliant system.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a legal mandate to use Peppol?">
    There is no legal mandate to use Peppol in Germany. The requirement is to issue and receive invoices in a structured, EN 16931-compliant format (like XRechnung or ZUGFeRD).

    In practice, Peppol is by far the most widely used network, because it is the standardized, government‑endorsed way to exchange XRechnung invoices electronically with German public authorities and, increasingly, with large businesses. Using Peppol ensures:

      * Interoperability with virtually all public sector recipients.
      * Compliance with format and technical rules without having to negotiate separate connections or portals.
      * Access via certified Peppol Access Points, which handle validation and delivery.
      * Other delivery channels exist (email, portal upload), but they are often less convenient, less standardized, and may not scale for high-volume or cross-border invoicing. So, while Peppol isn’t legally required, almost everyone uses it in practice for compliance and efficiency.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there any issuing timing requirements in Germany?">
    Timing is linked to contractual and procedural deadlines, not a specific law that defines a universal submission window. However, in the context of B2G many authorities specify invoice submission within 10 days of service completion in their contracts or portals, so it's best to issue the invoice as early as possible.

    In the case of B2B the general VAT rule states that the invoice must be issued within 15 days after the end of the month in which the supply was made, if the transaction is subject to VAT and involves another taxable business. This 15-day window is critical because late issuance can make VAT reporting inconsistent between supplier and customer and it may also affect the buyer’s right to input VAT deduction.
