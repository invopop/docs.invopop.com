## Executive summary

XRechnung is Germany’s official standard for electronic invoices in public procurement (called E-Rechnungen), though it is also used for B2B transactions. It’s part of the implementation of the EU directive 2014/55/EU, which requires all contracting authorities in the EU to accept electronic invoices in a structured XML file. It can be implemented using two different syntaxes, CII and UBL. They both contain the same information, but have different field names.

ZUGFeRD is a German standard for electronic invoicing designed to bridge the gap between traditional invoices and digital formats. ZUGFeRD combines a standard PDF/A-3 invoice with an embedded XML file containing the structured data. This hybrid approach makes it especially popular in B2B transactions, as it allows both people and accounting software to work with the same document. It is fully aligned with the European Norm EN 16931. It is worth noting that ZUGFeRD and Factur-X are a joint project between Germany and France, and their content is identical.
