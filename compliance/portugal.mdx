## Executive summary

Portugal mandates electronic invoicing for all B2B transactions starting January 1, 2026, through the **ACTUD/QR** system. This regulation requires businesses to use approved software that generates invoices with unique validation codes (ACTUD) assigned by the Portuguese Tax Authority (AT), ensuring transparency and preventing fraud. Each invoice must include a QR code that links to the AT's online verification service, allowing customers and tax authorities to validate invoice authenticity.

Invocing in Portugal is based on the EN 16931 standard with CUIS extensions, requiring businesses to notify the AT of their numbering series before issuance. The AT then validates and issues unique codes for each series, creating a centralized tracking mechanism for all invoices.

Portugal also requires **SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax)** reporting, an XML-based format used to submit accounting and invoicing data to tax authorities. This system enables standardized digital audits and tax compliance, with mandatory reporting for B2G and B2B transactions from January 1, 2024.

This article provides comprehensive guidance on [ACTUD/QR invoicing requirements](#actudqr-b2b-b2g), [SAF-T reporting](#saft-pt-b2b-b2g), and [Portuguese invoicing regulations](#regulation).

Invopop provides comprehensive coverage for Portuguese invoicing through dedicated apps for AT Portugal and InvoiceXpress Portugal, as well as integrations with platforms like Stripe and Chargebee. This allows businesses to issue compliant ACTUD invoices efficiently and manage white-label (B2B2B) operations.

## Invoicing in Portugal

Portugal does not mandate a specific electronic invoice format. Instead, businesses report tax information to the Portuguese Tax Authority (AT - Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira) either periodically through SAF-T (PT) reports or in real time via web service.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ACTUD/QR (B2B, B2G)">

Although no format is required, all electronic invoices must include ATCUD and a QR code.

1. **ATCUD (Unique Code)**: 
   - Businesses must register their invoice numbering series with the AT
   - The AT issues a validation code for each registered series
   - This code must appear on each invoice

2. **QR Code**:
   - All e-invoices must contain a QR code
   - The QR code links to the AT's online verification service

## E-reporting

The SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) system was introduced in Portugal in 2008 to facilitate the electronic submission of VAT returns, accounting records, and transport documents. This system requires files to be generated in specific formats containing detailed information regarding commercial transactions. Taxpayers with headquarters, based or permanently established in Portugal, subject to corporate tax (IRC) or income tax (IRS) that keep organized accounting, must comply with this system.
