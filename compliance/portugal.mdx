## Executive summary

Portugal mandates electronic invoicing for all B2B transactions starting January 1, 2026, through the **ACTUD/QR** system. This regulation requires businesses to use approved software that generates invoices with unique validation codes (ACTUD) assigned by the Portuguese Tax Authority (AT), ensuring transparency and preventing fraud. Each invoice must include a QR code that links to the AT's online verification service, allowing customers and tax authorities to validate invoice authenticity.

Invocing in Portugal is based on the EN 16931 standard with CUIS extensions, requiring businesses to notify the AT of their numbering series before issuance. The AT then validates and issues unique codes for each series, creating a centralized tracking mechanism for all invoices.

Portugal also requires **SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax)** reporting, an XML-based format used to submit accounting and invoicing data to tax authorities. This system enables standardized digital audits and tax compliance, with mandatory reporting for B2G and B2B transactions from January 1, 2024.

This article provides comprehensive guidance on [ACTUD/QR invoicing requirements](#actudqr-b2b-b2g), [SAF-T reporting](#saft-pt-b2b-b2g), and [Portuguese invoicing regulations](#regulation).

Invopop provides comprehensive coverage for Portuguese invoicing through dedicated apps for AT Portugal and InvoiceXpress Portugal, as well as integrations with platforms like Stripe and Chargebee. This allows businesses to issue compliant ACTUD invoices efficiently and manage white-label (B2B2B) operations.

## Invoicing in Portugal

Portugal's electronic invoicing has two main requisites:

* **ACTUD** is a unique code assigned to each invoice. Taxpayers must notify the Portuguese Tax Authority (AT) of the numbering series they intend to use for their invoices, then the AT will issue a validation code for each reported numbering series. 
* **QR Code** e-invoices must include a QR code that links to the online verification service of the AT.

    Portugal's regulation requires businesses to use approved software that uses authorized codes (ACTUD) for each invoice to ensure transparency and prevent fraud. The format requires a QR code which links to the online verification service of the AT.

## E-reporting

The SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) system was introduced in Portugal in 2008 to facilitate the electronic submission of VAT returns, accounting records, and transport documents. This system requires files to be generated in specific formats containing detailed information regarding commercial transactions. Taxpayers with headquarters, based or permanently established in Portugal, subject to corporate tax (IRC) or income tax (IRS) that keep organized accounting, must comply with this system.

  <Accordion title="B2G Invoicing">
    eInvoicing for public procurement is managed through [BASE](https://www.base.gov.pt/base4), a central platform that provides solutions like acinGov and saphetygov for electronic invoicing. While the FE-AP platform can be used to receive invoices, its use is not mandatory, leading to various methods for sending invoices, including web-based services, direct electronic connections, third-party portals, or email.

  <Accordion title="Archival period">
    Business owners must keep transaction records for 10 years. If the tax settlement period is longer than 10 years, the recording of transactions has to be maintained until the end of the settlement period.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should our customers upload their SAF-T files manually?">
  In Portugal, fiscally relevant documents issued through invoicing software must be reported to the Tax Authority (AT). There are two possible reporting models:

  1. **SAF-T monthly export** – a single XML file including all documents for the month. This file is generated by the invoicing software and then uploaded manually to the AT portal, as there is no API available for submitting it automatically.
  2. **Real-time transmission** – instead of a monthly file, each invoice is sent individually to the AT at the time of issuance, using the authority’s API.

  Whether one model or the other is used usually depends on the issuers accountant’s preference (who typically upload the SAF-T monthly report should they choose that model)
  If you're using our [InvoiceXpress solution](/apps/invoicexpress), then each supplier can configure SAF-T generation or real-time submission directly in the InvoiceXpress portal.
  If instead you’re using [our own certified solution](/apps/pt-at), at this moment we support SAF-T generation. We will also enable real-time AT reporting as an alternative in Q4, 2025.
