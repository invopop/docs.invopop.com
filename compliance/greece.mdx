## Executive summary

Greece mandates e-reporting through the **myDATA** (My Digital Accounting and Tax Application) platform, managed by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR). This system requires businesses to report invoices and accounting data in real time, ensuring compliance with Greek tax regulations and enabling automatic generation of electronic accounting books.

Invopop has partnered with ILYDA to issue invoices in Greece. Each supplier must be registered with ILYDA to issue invoices on their behalf.

Starting in February 2026, companies with revenues exceeding €1 million in the 2023 fiscal year will be required to issue electronic invoices for domestic B2B transactions and transactions with companies from third countries (outside the European Union). All other businesses must comply by October 1, 2026. Consult our [Greece's e-invoicing regulation timeline](/timelines/greece) for an overview of upcoming regulation in Greece.

Greece's e-invoicing system is based on the **EN 16931** standard with CUIS extensions, requiring invoices in XML format. The system uses a hybrid infrastructure model combining public and private platforms, with centralized validation and tracking through myDATA.

Invopop provides comprehensive coverage for Greek invoicing through the ILYDA Greece app, as well as integrations with platforms like Stripe and Chargebee. This allows businesses to issue compliant EN 16931 invoices efficiently and manage white-label (B2B2B) operations.

  <Accordion title="EN 16931 (B2C, B2B, B2G)">
    EN 16931 is the European standard that defines the semantic data model for electronic invoices. It establishes a common structure and set of data elements to ensure interoperability across countries, systems, and sectors within the EU. The standard allows implementations in syntaxes like UBL or CII. Its goal is to simplify cross-border trade, reduce administrative costs, and support the digital transformation of public and private procurement across Europe.

## E-reporting

E-reporting is the mandatory electronic submission of invoice data to tax authorities, usually in real time, for compliance and audit purposes. This enables tax administrations to monitor transactions and ensure VAT control as part of broader continuous transaction control (CTC) systems.

All companies resident in Greece (or in any event subject to local accounting requirements) have to comply with the system, with no threshold foreseen. The taxable person with a turnover of less than EUR 50.000 or issuing less than 50 invoices per year will be able to use a special data entry form, which allows them to manually upload invoice data on the myDATA web portal.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MyDATA (B2C, B2B, B2G)">

myDATA is Greece's real-time electronic invoicing and reporting platform that digitizes accounting data for B2G, B2B, and B2C transactions. Companies must send transaction and accounting data to myDATA, which validates it and assigns a unique identifier (MARK). The system automatically generates electronic accounting books (a detailed book and a summary book) and is crucial for tax compliance.

## Regulation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the process for public procurement?">
    The main eInvoice process flow scenario for public procurement is the following:
    
    1. Preparation of eInvoice data by the supplier/contractor and transmission to an eInvoicing service provider.
    2. The eInvoicing service provider validates invoice data before submitting it, using the respective Interoperability Centre services.
    3. The eInvoicing service provider reports and registers the eInvoice, for taxation reasons, to “MyData” application i.e. to a digital financial information application for taxation operated by the Independent Authority of Public Revenue in Greece.
    4. The eInvoicing service provider prepares the eInvoice based on the European standard semantic model, the national specification that derives from the Joint Ministerial Decisions, and the Peppol Business Interoperability Specification.
    5. The eInvoicing service provider submits the eInvoice to the access point of the Interoperability Centre through the Peppol network.
    6. The Interoperability Centre receives and validates the eInvoice, according to the European and national rules for eInvoicing,
    7. The Interoperability Centre routes the eInvoice to the competent contracting authority or competent IT system of the public body,
    8. The competent contracting authority and financial service handle the invoice according to their internal procurement and payment practices using one of the IT systems or web application mentioned in the previous section. The competent authorities send the appropriate messages regarding the status of the processing of the eInvoice through the Interoperability Centre and the eInvoicing service providers to the supplier/contractor.

  <Accordion title="What is the archival period for invoices in Greece">
    Greece requires archiving invoices during 5 years.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supplier onboarding process">
  Invopop has partnered with ILYDA to issue invoices in Greece. Each supplier must be registered with ILYDA to issue invoices on their behalf. This involves:

    * Authorizing ILYDA as an electronic invoicing provider in Taxisnet.
    * Declaring ILYDA as invoice issuer in myDATA.
    * Signing a service provision agreement with ILYDA.
    * Please contact us via Slack or support@invopop.com whenever you need to onboard a new supplier. We will walk you through the process.

    Supplier registration is only possible in production. In the sandbox environment, your invoices must use a supplier with the tax ID code set to `177472438` which is the TIN of the test supplier pre-enabled in that environment.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are Greek invoice types specified?">
    The Greek tax authority (IAPR) requires the invoice type to be specified as part of the invoice. In GOBL, this type can be set using the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension in the tax section and setting the GOBL invoice type to other.

    Alternatively, GOBL will set the extension for you based on the type and the tax tags you set in your GOBL invoice. You can read more in the [GOBL Greece Tax Regime readme](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/gr/README.md).

    If you produce a PDF version of the invoice, the invoice type label will be displayed instead of "Invoice".
