## Executive summary

Mexico mandates electronic invoicing through the **CFDI** (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet) system, managed by the **SAT** (Servicio de Administración Tributaria). Since April 2024, all taxpayers must issue electronic invoices in XML format. The system uses a clearance model, where invoices must be validated and certified by an authorized certification provider (PAC) before being sent to SAT in real time. This real-time reporting gives SAT continuous visibility into all business transactions, enabling automated VAT reconciliation and streamlined audits. The CFDI system covers B2B, B2C, and B2G transactions.

## Mexico

The CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet) is the standardized electronic invoicing format in Mexico, managed by the country’s tax authority, the SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria). This system ensures that all fiscal documents are digitally generated, validated, and reported to SAT in compliance with national tax laws.

## E-reporting

In Mexico, e-reporting is fully integrated into the e-invoicing system. Every issued invoice is reported to the SAT in real time through authorized certification providers (PACs). These intermediaries validate the XML structure, apply a digital signature, and forward the document to SAT, effectively making each invoice a live tax report. As a result, SAT receives a continuous feed of all business transactions—sales, payments, credit notes, payroll, and even goods transport—without separate periodic submissions. This model gives SAT near-total visibility over the economy, allowing automated VAT reconciliation, audit-by-data, and pre-filled tax returns.

  <Accordion title="Archival period">

  According to Article 30 of the Federal Tax Code, businesses in Mexico must keep all their accounting records, including electronic invoices, for five years. This period is counted as follows:

  * It starts from the date the relevant tax return was filed, or should have been filed.
  * For accounting records that cover a longer period, the five years start from the tax return of the last fiscal year covered by those records.
  * If the records were part of a legal case or appeal, the period begins on the date the final decision is issued.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a PAC?">
  In the Mexican invoicing system, a PAC is a “Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación” or Authorized Certification Provider. The SAT requires that all electronic invoices (CFDIs) be validated and certified. A PAC is an officially authorized private company that handles this certification process. They verify that the invoice complies with SAT rules, assign the digital seal, and send it back to the issuer.
  Essentially, a PAC acts as a trusted intermediary between businesses and the tax authority, ensuring that electronic invoices are legally recognized and properly formatted. Invopop uses [SW Sapien](https://smarterweb.com.mx), an Authorised Certification Provider (PAC), to sign and stamp CFDI documents for the Mexican tax authority.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to issue B2C invoices in Mexico">
    Purchases under $100 mxn don't need to be issued, but they need to be registered in the global CFDI. Often issuing all invoices will simplify your operation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does invopop support the white label (B2B2B) model in Mexico?">
    Yes. We must obtain a the supplier's CSD (digtial seal) and credentials to issue invoices in that company's name. We are especially powerful and simple for this. Read more in our [white label use case](/guides/white-label).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does it mean that Mexico has a clearance model for invoicing?">
    A clearance model (sometimes called real-time validation or pre-clearance) is a regulatory architecture in which each invoice must be electronically submitted to the tax authority and formally approved before it becomes legally valid. The government acts as an intermediary between the supplier and the buyer and the invoice will only be valid with state authorization. Only after authorization you can dispatch goods, book revenue or send an invoice to the customer.
