## Executive summary

Singapore's e-invoicing and reporting framework is built around a single nationwide network — InvoiceNow — operated by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and anchored in the internationally recognized Peppol standard. Rather than a patchwork of regional systems, Singapore has pursued a unified, phased approach.

[GST InvoiceNow Requirement](#invoicenow-b2b-b2g) is already mandatory for newly incorporated companies that voluntarily register for GST, and will progressively extend to all GST-registered businesses. It requires structured invoice data to be transmitted to IRAS via the Peppol network, using a five-corner model where IRAS is the fifth corner.

[GST F5 Reporting](#gst-f5-reporting) requires all GST-registered businesses to file quarterly aggregate VAT returns via IRAS's myTax Portal.

This article also provides insight and further resources to understand [invoice regulation in Singapore](#regulation).

## Invoicing in Singapore

Singapore's approach to invoicing digitalization is centralized and standards-driven. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) governs the InvoiceNow network, while the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is responsible for GST enforcement and the mandatory e-reporting dimension. Singapore became the first Peppol Authority outside Europe in 2018, giving businesses on the network built-in cross-border interoperability with all other Peppol-connected jurisdictions.

- [GST InvoiceNow Requirement](#invoicenow-b2b-b2g) — mandatory for new voluntary GST registrants, rolling out to all GST-registered businesses through 2026 and beyond.
- [GST F5 Reporting](#gst-f5-reporting-large-companies) — quarterly aggregate GST returns required for all GST-registered businesses.

### Singapore

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GST InvoiceNow Requirement (B2B, B2G)">
    <Warning>
    Mandatory from **1 November 2025** for newly incorporated companies that voluntarily register for GST. Mandatory from **1 April 2026** for all new voluntary GST registrants. Extension to compulsory registrants and all existing GST-registered businesses is planned for subsequent phases (dates TBC by IRAS).
    </Warning>

    Singapore's nationwide e-invoicing and e-reporting mandate, requiring GST-registered businesses to transmit structured invoice data to IRAS via the Peppol-based InvoiceNow network. Invoices are sent in real time through an IMDA-accredited Access Point provider, with IRAS acting as the fifth corner of the network — receiving a copy of every covered transaction. The system uses the **PINT-SG** format (progressively replacing Singapore BIS Billing 3.0), based on OASIS UBL 2.1 XML with Singapore-specific adaptations including GST registration numbers, PayNow/GIRO payment methods, and IRAS validation rules.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Facturae equivalent — not applicable">
    Singapore does not operate a separate B2G invoicing format. Government agencies receive e-invoices through the same InvoiceNow/Peppol network, centrally processed by the Accountant-General's Department. InvoiceNow is already the preferred channel for government vendors and is expected to become mandatory for all registered government suppliers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## E-reporting

Involves sending invoice data or aggregate tax information to IRAS, either in near real time (via InvoiceNow) or periodically (via the GST F5 return).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GST F5 Reporting (all GST-registered businesses)">
    All GST-registered businesses must file a quarterly GST return (Form F5) via IRAS's myTax Portal, reporting aggregate totals across output tax, input tax, and net GST payable. Returns are due one month after the end of each accounting period. The GST F5 is not replaced by InvoiceNow — both obligations coexist.

    |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | **Scope** | B2C, B2B, B2G |
    | **Format** | Aggregate return (15-box GST F5 form) |
    | **Compliance** | E-reporting |
    | **Effective date** | Mandatory for all GST-registered businesses |
    | **Notes** | Monthly filing available by election. Nil returns required even with no transactions. Late filing incurs a S$200 penalty per month, up to S$10,000 per return. |

## Regulation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legally required invoice content">

    **Full Tax Invoice (B2B — required when total exceeds S$1,000)**

    A GST-registered supplier must issue a full tax invoice within **30 days** of the time of supply. It must contain:

    - The words "Tax Invoice" displayed prominently
    - A unique, sequential serial number
    - Date of issue
    - Supplier's name, address, and GST registration number
    - Customer's name and address
    - Description of goods or services supplied
    - Quantity and unit price (excluding GST) for each line item
    - Any discounts or reductions applied
    - The GST rate (9%)
    - Total GST amount in Singapore dollars
    - Total amount payable including GST
    - Indication of whether each supply is standard-rated (9%), zero-rated (0%), or exempt

    **Simplified Tax Invoice (total payable S$1,000 or less)**

    A simplified tax invoice may be issued and requires only:

    - Supplier's name, address, and GST registration number
    - Date of issue
    - Sequential serial number
    - Description of goods or services
    - Total amount payable including GST (GST need not be shown separately)

    Customer details and per-line GST breakdowns are not required on simplified invoices.

    **Credit Notes**

    Credit notes must include the words "Credit Note" prominently, the supplier's GST registration details, the reason for the credit, a reference to the original tax invoice, and the GST rate and amount credited. Credit notes that do not adjust GST must state "This is not a credit note for GST purposes."

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue a tax invoice">

    A GST-registered business does not need to issue a tax invoice for:

    1. **Zero-rated supplies** (exports of goods, international services) — a commercial invoice or export documentation suffices, though GST records must still be maintained.
    2. **Exempt supplies** — including most financial services, residential property leases, and investment-grade precious metals. No tax invoice is required, and input tax on costs related to exempt supplies generally cannot be claimed.
    3. **Supplies to non-GST-registered customers** — a simplified invoice or receipt is acceptable. A full tax invoice is only required when the customer is GST-registered and requests one.
    4. **Deemed supplies** — such as gifts exceeding S$200 in value; these are self-accounted and do not require an outward invoice.

    Even in these cases, you must issue a tax invoice if a GST-registered customer requests one for input tax claim purposes.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archival period">

    **The archival period for invoices and accounting records in Singapore is as follows:**

    - **5 years (IRAS — GST and income tax):**
    The standard minimum. Records must be retained for five years from the end of the relevant GST accounting period or Year of Assessment — even after a business ceases operations or deregisters from GST. Required under Section 67 of the Income Tax Act and Section 46 of the GST Act.

    - **5 years (ACRA — Companies Act):**
    Section 199 of the Companies Act independently requires companies to retain accounting records for five years from the end of the financial year in which the transactions were completed.

    - **Longer periods in special cases:**
      - **Ongoing audits or legal disputes:** Records must be retained until the matter is fully resolved.
      - **Capital assets:** Supporting records for capital expenditure claims should be retained for the full duration of claiming, which may exceed five years.

    Electronic records are fully acceptable for all tax purposes with no prior IRAS approval required, provided they remain accessible, retain their original form, and are protected from tampering with a proper audit trail.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="InvoiceNow onboarding and access points">

    To connect to InvoiceNow, a business requires:

    - A valid **Unique Entity Number (UEN)**
    - **CorpPass** KYC certification
    - A connection to an **IMDA-accredited Access Point provider** (Peppol Service Provider)

    Businesses using off-the-shelf accounting software should check IMDA's list of **InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers (IRSPs)** for compatible products. Businesses running in-house ERP systems should engage an accredited Access Point directly — integration typically takes 3 to 12 months.

    Financial support available:
    - **Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG):** Up to S$30,000
    - **InvoiceNow Accelerate programme:** One year of free services for newly incorporated businesses
    - Free-of-charge solution packages from select IRSPs

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GST registration and rates">

    **Registration threshold:** Businesses with annual taxable turnover exceeding **S$1 million** must register for GST — assessed either retrospectively (at calendar year-end) or prospectively (when turnover is expected to exceed S$1 million in the next 12 months). Late registration carries a fine of up to S$10,000 plus a 10% surcharge on GST due from the date liability arose.

    **Current GST rates:**

    | Supply type | Rate |
    |---|---|
    | Standard-rated (local B2B and B2C supplies) | 9% |
    | Zero-rated (exports of goods, international services) | 0% |
    | Exempt (financial services, residential property, precious metals) | N/A |

    **Cross-border and digital services:**
    - **Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime:** Overseas suppliers of digital services, remote services, and low-value goods (≤ S$400) to Singapore consumers must register for GST if global turnover exceeds S$1 million and Singapore B2C supplies exceed S$100,000.
    - **Reverse charge:** Partially exempt GST-registered businesses that import services must self-account for GST as if they were the supplier.
    - **Import GST:** GST at 9% applies on the CIF value plus customs duty for goods imported into Singapore. The Major Exporter Scheme and Import GST Deferment Scheme provide relief for qualifying businesses.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="IRAS audits and voluntary disclosure">

    IRAS conducts risk-based GST audits rather than mandatory fiscal device checks. Key compliance tools include:

    - **IRAS Audit File (IAF):** A detailed pipe-delimited or XML file generated from the general ledger, required when selected for audit. Most major accounting software supports IAF generation.
    - **GST Assisted Self-Help Kit (ASK):** A voluntary self-assessment framework with three components — internal process review, pre-filing checklist, and annual review of prior submissions. Mandatory when applying for certain GST schemes (e.g., Import GST Deferment Scheme).
    - **Voluntary Disclosure Programme:** Errors voluntarily disclosed within one year of the filing deadline qualify for reduced or waived penalties. Disclosure via GST ASK strengthens the case for penalty reduction.

    Penalties for non-compliance:
    - Late or incorrect GST returns: up to 200% of tax undercharged
    - Inadequate record-keeping: up to S$5,000 (GST Act), S$1,000 (Income Tax Act), or S$5,000 / 12 months' imprisonment (Companies Act)
    - Non-registration: fine up to S$10,000 plus 10% surcharge on GST owed
