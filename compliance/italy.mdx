## Executive summary

Italy mandates electronic invoicing for all businesses through the **Sistema di Interscambio (SDI)**, the Italian government's central hub for transmitting, validating, and delivering all electronic invoices. The system operates using **FatturaPA**, a standardized XML format that ensures invoices comply with strict validation rules established by the Italian tax authority (Agenzia delle Entrate). B2B and B2G transactions must be issued through SDI using FatturaPA format, while B2C transactions require **Documento Commerciale**, a digital fiscal receipt that transmits sales data to the Agenzia delle Entrate.

The SDI system uses a unique Recipient Code—a seven-digit alphanumeric identifier—to route invoices to the correct recipient. For B2G transactions, invoices must also include a Unique Code (IPA code) to identify the specific government agency office. The system provides real-time validation and delivery confirmation, with automatic status notifications throughout the invoice lifecycle.

Italy operates a full real-time e-reporting system embedded within its mandatory electronic invoicing regime. All invoices transmitted through SDI are automatically forwarded to the Agenzia delle Entrate, giving tax authorities immediate visibility of every transaction.

Invopop simplifies SDI integration by allowing you to work with GOBL format instead of XML, providing synchronous validation before submission, and offering a simple API integration with automatic handling of SDI notifications and status updates. Invopop provides comprehensive coverage through dedicated apps for SDI Italy and Smart Receipts Italy, as well as integrations with platforms like Stripe and Chargebee.

## Italy

Electronic invoicing is mandatory for all businesses in Italy. The Sistema di Interscambio (SDI) serves as the Italian government’s central hub for transmitting, validating, and delivering all electronic invoices throughout the country.

The SDI system operates using a standardized XML format called **FatturaPA**, which ensures all invoices contain the required information and comply with the strict validation rules established by the Italian tax authority (Agenzia delle Entrate). To ensure proper routing of invoices to the correct recipient, the SDI system uses a unique identifier called a Recipient Code, which is assigned to each registered SDI provider.

In italy, B2B and B2G transactions are required to be issued through the SDI system. B2C transactions are required to be issued through the **Documento Commerciale** system.

The **Documento Commerciale** is a digital fiscal document that records sales transactions and transmits them to the Agenzia delle Entrate (AdE). This digital receipt replaces traditional paper receipts while maintaining full fiscal compliance and serves as official proof of purchase for your customers. Italian law requires businesses to transmit sales data digitally through either a certified Registratore Telematico (RT) or the AdE’s online portal.

## E-reporting

Italy operates a full real-time e-reporting system embedded within its mandatory electronic invoicing regime. All B2B, B2C, and B2G invoices are issued in FatturaPA XML and transmitted through the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI), which forwards data directly to the Agenzia delle Entrate, giving tax authorities immediate visibility of every transaction. Retail sales are covered through the documento commerciale, whose daily totals are automatically sent by certified cash registers. Since July 2022, cross-border transactions must be reported via SdI using special invoice types (TD17–TD19), completing Italy’s real-time coverage of domestic and foreign sales.

If you are issuing FatturaPA invoices and Documento Commerciale receipts, you are already covered by the e-reporting system.

## Regulation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legally required invoice content">

  **Complete (B2B) Invoice**

 Mandatory information for electronic invoices includes:
 * Invoice issue date
 * Unique, sequential invoice number
 * Issuer data (i.e., company, business, or trading name; first and last name; residence or domicile)
 * Customer data (i.e., company, business, or trading name; first and last name; residence or domicile)
 * Customer’s VAT identification number or, in the case of a taxable person established in another EU member state, the VAT identification number issued by that state
 * Description, quantity, and price of the goods or services involved in the transaction
 * Date on which the goods or services were supplied
 * Date on which payment was made, if different from the invoice date
 * VAT rate and taxable amount
 * Recipient code (i.e., a seven-digit, alphanumeric identifier used to ensure the proper delivery of an electronic invoice to a business or professional)

  **Simplified Invoice**

* Invoice issue date
* Unique, sequential invoice number
* Issuer data (i.e., company, business, or trading name; first and last name; residence or domicile)
* VAT number
* Customer information (i.e., first and last name, address, and tax code, as this is an individual without a VAT number)
* Description, quantity, and price of the goods or services involved in the transaction
* Date on which the goods or services were provided
* Date of payment, if different from the invoice date
* VAT rate and taxable amount
* The code “0000000” in the beneficiary code field

**B2G Invoice**

In addition to the above, B2G invoices must include the following:

* **Unique code**<br />This is a six-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a specific government agency and ensures the e-invoice is routed correctly. A single public entity can have multiple unique codes, each assigned to a different office within the organisation. It’s also known as a “unique office code” or “IPA code” (referring to the Index of Public Administrations [IPA]). The unique code is mandatory.
* **CIG code**<br />This is a 10-digit, alphanumeric code used to identify an offer. It must be indicated on the invoice, unless an exemption from the traceability requirement applies, as provided for by Law No. 136 of 13 August 2010.
* **CUP code**<br />This is a 15-character, alphanumeric code that identifies a public investment project. It should only be entered if specifically requested by the company.
