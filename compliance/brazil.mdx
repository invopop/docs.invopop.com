## Executive summary

Brazil operates a sophisticated, mandatory electronic invoicing system that covers different document types through **SEFAZ (Secretaria da Fazenda)**, the state tax authority infrastructure. The system has been mandatory since 2008 and uses a **clearance model** (also known as continuous transaction control or CTC), where each invoice must be electronically submitted to tax authorities and formally authorized before it becomes legally valid. This real-time validation ensures that businesses cannot dispatch goods, book revenue, or send invoices to customers until the government has approved the transaction.

The Brazilian e-invoicing system encompasses multiple document types for different transaction scenarios. **NF-e (Nota Fiscal Eletrônica)** is used for B2B and B2G sales of goods and products, requiring authorization before shipping. **NFC-e (Nota Fiscal de Consumidor Eletrônica)** covers B2C retail transactions for face-to-face sales or home delivery. **NFS-e (Nota Fiscal de Serviços Eletrônica)** handles B2B and B2G service transactions, with tax assessed by municipalities. **NFCom** applies to telecommunications and communication services, becoming mandatory in November 2025. Additionally, **CT-e (Conhecimento de Transporte Eletrônico)** and **MDF-e (Manifesto Eletrônico de Documentos Fiscais)** cover transportation of goods and grouping of multiple fiscal documents, respectively.

Brazil operates a comprehensive e-reporting system through **SPED (Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital)**, which collects financial, accounting, tax, and labor information from Brazilian companies.

Invopop provides comprehensive coverage for Brazilian invoicing through the **Documentos Fiscais Eletrônicos Brazil** app, supporting NF-e, NFS-e, and NFC-e documents. The platform also offers integrations with Stripe and Chargebee, enabling businesses to issue compliant invoices directly from their merchant or ERP platforms while automatically handling the complex SEFAZ authorization process.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does it mean that Brazil has a clearance model for invoicing?">
    A clearance model (sometimes called real-time validation or pre-clearance) is a regulatory architecture in which each invoice must be electronically submitted to the tax authority and formally approved before it becomes legally valid. The government acts as an intermediary between the supplier and the buyer and the invoice will only be valid with state authorization. Only after authorization you can dispatch goods, book revenue or send an invoice to the customer.
