## Executive summary

Norway is Europe's most mature PEPPOL adopter, with mandatory B2G e-invoicing since 2012 and a proposed B2B mandate targeting 2028. Though not an EU member, Norway voluntarily aligns with European digital standards — it uses PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 (based on EN 16931) as its national invoicing format and is actively positioning itself ahead of the EU's ViDA timeline.

[PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0](#b2g-e-invoicing) has been mandatory for all public sector suppliers since April 2019. Nearly 360,000 receivers are registered in ELMA, Norway's national PEPPOL registry, and approximately 170 million invoice transactions are processed annually.

[SAF-T Financial](#saf-t) has been mandatory since January 2020 for all enterprises with a bookkeeping obligation that store accounting information electronically. Version 1.30 became mandatory from January 2025.

[B2B e-invoicing](#b2b-e-invoicing-mandate) is currently voluntary but a formal mandate has been proposed, with a consultation closed in October 2025. The proposal targets mandatory sending by 2028 and mandatory receiving by 2030.

## Invoicing in Norway

Norway built its e-invoicing infrastructure on PEPPOL, of which it was a founding participant. The national EHF (Elektronisk HandelsFormat) standard has fully converged with PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 — EHF 3.0 is not a separate format but a rebranding of PEPPOL BIS. All public sector invoicing runs through the PEPPOL eDelivery Network via certified Access Points, with ELMA serving as the national PEPPOL SMP registry.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2G e-invoicing (PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0)">

    Norway mandates electronic invoicing for all public procurement transactions. Suppliers to the entire public sector must submit invoices in PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 format via the PEPPOL network.

  <Accordion title="B2B e-invoicing mandate (proposed)">

    <Warning>
    The B2B mandate is not yet law. A consultation closed on 31 October 2025 and final legislative decisions remain pending as of February 2026.
    </Warning>

    The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has launched a formal evaluation of mandatory B2B e-invoicing. The proposal, prepared by Skatteetaten, would require all businesses with bookkeeping obligations to send and receive invoices in PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 format via the PEPPOL network.

    |            |             |
    |------------|-------------|
    | **Scope** | B2B |
    | **Format** | PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 |
    | **Proposed send date** | **1 January 2028** |
    | **Proposed receive date** | **1 January 2030** |
    | **Exemptions** | Sole proprietors without accounting obligations and turnover below NOK 50,000; bankruptcy estates; B2C, cash sales, and exports to foreign customers |
    | **Agency** | [Skatteetaten](https://www.skatteetaten.no) |

## SAF-T

Norway's SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) framework has been mandatory since 1 January 2020 for all enterprises with a bookkeeping obligation that store accounting information electronically. SAF-T is submitted on-demand only — when requested by tax authorities during an audit — with no periodic filing requirement.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SAF-T Financial">

    |            |             |
    |------------|-------------|
    | **Scope** | All bookkeeping-obligated businesses (including foreign entities with a permanent establishment in Norway) |
    | **Format** | SAF-T Financial (XML) |
    | **Current version** | **1.30** (mandatory from 1 January 2025) |
    | **Submission** | On-demand via [Altinn](https://www.altinn.no) portal or ERP API |
    | **Turnover exemption** | Annual turnover below NOK 5 million (unless accounting data is already digital) |
    | **Voucher exemption** | Fewer than 600 vouchers annually using spreadsheets |
    | **Agency** | [Skatteetaten](https://www.skatteetaten.no) |

    Version 1.30 introduced significant changes: removal of standard chart-of-accounts mapping (replaced by `GroupingCategory` and `GroupingCode`), new balance account structures, new VAT presentation methods, and previously voluntary elements becoming mandatory. Version 1.20 remains valid for financial year 2024 and earlier.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SAF-T Cash Register">

    A separate SAF-T component covering POS transaction data. Required for businesses subject to the Kassasystemloven (Cash Register Systems Act) — companies with bookkeeping obligations conducting cash sales above NOK 50,000 (excl. VAT) annually.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## VAT reporting

Norway's VAT return (mva-meldingen) was modernized on 1 January 2022, replacing the old RF-0002 form. The new return has 30 boxes (vs. the previous 19), aligned with SAF-T standard tax codes. All filing is mandatory electronic submission via Altinn or ERP API connections.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="VAT return (mva-meldingen)">

    |            |             |
    |------------|-------------|
    | **Standard frequency** | Bi-monthly (6 periods) |
    | **Annual filing** | Available for businesses with turnover below NOK 1 million |
    | **Primary industries** | Annually by default (agriculture, forestry, fisheries) |
    | **Foreign sellers (VOEC/VOES)** | Quarterly |
    | **Submission** | [Altinn](https://www.altinn.no) portal or ERP API |
    | **Agency** | [Skatteetaten](https://www.skatteetaten.no) |

    Bi-monthly deadlines fall one month and ten days after each two-month period (e.g., January–February is due by April 10). Corrections must be submitted as full replacement returns rather than delta-only.

## Regulation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legally required invoice content">

    Norwegian invoice content requirements derive from **Bokføringsforskriften (Bookkeeping Regulations) § 5-1-1 and § 5-1-2** and the **Merverdiavgiftsloven** (VAT Act).

    **Complete invoice**

    * Sequential invoice number and documentation date
    * Seller's name and organization number with **"MVA" suffix** if VAT-registered
    * Buyer identification (name plus address or organization number)
    * Detailed description of goods or services
    * Time and place of delivery
    * Quantity and unit price
    * VAT rate and amount **in NOK** (even when invoicing in foreign currency)
    * Total amount including VAT
    * Payment due date
    * Items at different VAT rates must appear on separate lines
    * Limited liability companies (AS) and public limited companies (ASA) must include the word **"Foretaksregisteret"** — including on international invoices
    * For reverse-charge supplies, the invoice must indicate the mechanism applies

    **Simplified invoice**

    Permitted when the total consideration is less than **NOK 50,000 including VAT**. Requires only:

    * Seller details (name, address, MVA number)
    * Description of goods or services
    * Total consideration with VAT amount

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="VAT rates">

    Norway applies its own VAT legislation — the **Merverdiavgiftsloven** (Value Added Tax Act 2009). The VAT registration threshold is **NOK 50,000** in taxable turnover within 12 months (NOK 140,000 for charitable organizations).

    | Rate | Percentage | Application |
    |------|-----------|-------------|
    | Standard | **25%** | Most goods and services |
    | Reduced (food) | **15%** | Foodstuffs (excl. alcohol, tobacco); water/wastewater services (from 1 July 2025) |
    | Reduced (services) | **12%** | Passenger transport, hotel accommodation, cinema, museums, amusement parks, sporting events, public broadcasting |
    | Special (marine) | **11.11%** | Wild marine resources — introduced 1 January 2025 |
    | Zero rate | **0%** | Exports, international transport, newspapers (print/digital), books, electric vehicles (up to NOK 500,000 until 2026) |

    **Territorial notes**: Svalbard and Jan Mayen are VAT-free and fall outside the Norwegian VAT area. Exports from mainland Norway to Svalbard are zero-rated. Norwegian businesses purchasing taxable services from these territories must apply the reverse-charge mechanism.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archival period">

    Under **Bokføringsloven (Bookkeeping Act) § 13**:

    * **5 years** after the end of the financial year for primary documentation (invoices, vouchers, ledgers, mandatory financial reporting specifications)
    * **3.5 years** for secondary documentation (supporting specifications)
    * **10 years** for construction and engineering project accounts and certain banking records

    Records must generally be stored in Norway. Electronic records may be stored in another EEA country, the UK, or Switzerland if Skatteetaten is notified in writing (Bokføringsforskriften § 7-5). All archived material must remain readable, printable, secured against alteration, and available to control authorities throughout the retention period.
