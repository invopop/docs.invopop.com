## Executive summary

France operates a mandatory e-invoicing system through the **Peppol network**, where businesses connect through certified **Plateforme Agréée (PA)** platforms. The system uses a **centralized model** where each PA looks up the buyer in the state **Annuaire** directory and routes invoices to the buyer's PA over Peppol. In parallel, the PA submits the mandated e-invoice and e-report dataset to the government **data concentrator**, where the state stores VAT data for each transaction.

France's e-invoicing system encompasses different models for different transaction types. **B2G e-invoicing** has been mandatory since 2020, with all suppliers invoicing French public entities required to submit electronic invoices through **ChorusPro**, a government-provided platform that accepts multiple e-invoicing formats based on EN 16931 with Chorus Pro extensions. **B2B e-invoicing** is being rolled out in phases: a voluntary pilot phase in 2025, followed by mandatory acceptance for all businesses and mandatory issuance for large and medium-sized companies in September 2026, with full mandatory issuance for all businesses by September 2027. B2C invoicing is not required under the new e-invoicing mandate.

France handles e-reporting through approved **PDP (Plateforme de Dématérialisation Partenaire)** platforms as part of its electronic invoicing reform, creating a "five corner model" where e-reporting is integrated into the e-invoicing process. The system relies on the Peppol network infrastructure with additional French-specific requirements, and e-reporting becomes mandatory alongside e-invoicing in September 2026 for large and medium-sized companies, and September 2027 for all businesses.

Invopop is an officially approved PDP platform (immatriculée sous réserve) by the French tax administration and provides coverage for French invoicing through the **Peppol** and **ChorusPro France** apps. The platform also offers integrations with Stripe and Chargebee, enabling businesses to issue compliant invoices directly from their merchant or ERP platforms while automatically handling the complex PA routing and data concentrator submission process.

## E-invoicing in France

France runs on the Peppol network. Businesses connect through a certified **Plateforme Agréée** (PA). For each invoice, the PA looks up the buyer in the state **Annuaire** and routes the document to the buyer's PA over Peppol. In paralell, the PA submits the mandated e-invoice/e-report dataset to the government **data concentrator**, where the state stores the VAT data for each transaction.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Peppol (B2B, B2G)">
    <Warning>
    B2B e-invoicing will be rolled out in phases:
    - **2025**: Pilot phase
    - **September 2026**: All businesses must accept e-invoices; large and medium-sized companies must issue e-invoices
    - **September 2027**: All businesses must issue e-invoices
    </Warning>

    Though France has not explicitly mandated the use of the Peppol network, it is the default infrastructure for e-invoicing in France.

    B2G e-invoicing has been mandatory in France since 2020.

## E-reporting

France handles e-reporting through approved PDP (Plateforme de Dématérialisation Partenaire) platforms as part of its electronic invoicing reform. Invopop is an officially approved PDP platform, as listed on the French government’s [official list of approved platforms](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/liste-des-plateformes-agreees-immatriculees-sous-reserve).

Invopop is immatriculée sous réserve (registered under reserve) by the French tax administration, meaning we have successfully passed the first stage of the approval process and provided all necessary documentation for the registration procedure.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PPF (Portail Public de Facturation)">
  <Note>No PDP platform can be fully certified yet, as the technical compliance verification stage will not begin until late 2025.</Note>
    The French PDP system relies on the Peppol network infrastructure with additional French-specific requirements. This creates a “five corner model” for e-invoicing compliance in which e-reporting is integrated into the e-invoicing process.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to e-report imports?">
    If the supply is taxable under French reverse charge (i.e. VAT is paid on import), the transaction must be e-reported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When should I e-report payment data?">
    Report payment data only when VAT is due on receipt of payment, such as for services under "cash VAT" (TVA sur les encaissements).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does this apply to foreign businesses without a Fixed Establishment (FE) in France?">
    E-invoicing does not apply. If the business is liable to French VAT, e-reporting applies to the relevant flows. E-reporting for reverse-charge VAT and intra EU-acquisitions are deferred till 1 September 2027.
  </Accordion> 
  
  <Accordion title="How are credit notes and corrections handled?">
  E-invoices cannot be deleted or retracted. Instead a credit note or corrected invoice can be sent referencing the original invoice.
