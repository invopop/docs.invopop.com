## E-invoicing in France

France's e-invoicing reform aims to modernize tax collection, combat VAT fraud, and align with EU digitalization initiatives through a phased implementation approach.

France runs on the Peppol network. Businesses connect through a certified **Plateforme Agréée** (PA). For each invoice, the PA looks up the buyer in the state **Annuaire** and routes the document to the buyer's PA over Peppol. In paralell, the PA submits the mandated e-invoice/e-report dataset to the government **data concentrator**, where the state stores the VAT data for each transaction. 



<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Peppol (B2B, B2G)">
    B2G e-invoicing has been mandatory in France since 2020. All suppliers invoicing French public entities must submit electronic invoices through approved platforms.

<Note>B2C invoicing is not required in France under the new e-invoicing mandate.</Note>

## E-reporting

E-reporting lets the **DGFiP** receive VAT-relevant data for B2C and cross-border B2B/B2C sales on the cadence of each company's VAT regime. It aims to cut errors in returns, strengthen fraud detection and eventually enable prefilled VAT declarations. Mandatory from 1 September 2026 for large and intermediate enterprises; SMEs and micro-enterprises follow on 1 September 2027. 


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-Reporting">
Businesses submit aggregated transaction data via a PA in line with their VAT reporting regime cadence. The government stores the information in the data concentrator.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to e-report imports?">
    If the supply is taxable under French reverse charge (i.e. VAT is paid on import), the transaction must be e-reported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When should I e-report payment data?">
    Report payment data only when VAT is due on receipt of payment, such as for services under "cash VAT" (TVA sur les encaissements).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does this apply to foreign businesses without a Fixed Establishment (FE) in France?">
    E-invoicing does not apply. If the business is liable to French VAT, e-reporting applies to the relevant flows. E-reporting for reverse-charge VAT and intra EU-acquisitions are deferred till 1 September 2027.
  </Accordion> 
  
  <Accordion title="How are credit notes and corrections handled?">
  E-invoices cannot be deleted or retracted. Instead a credit note or corrected invoice can be sent referencing the original invoice.
