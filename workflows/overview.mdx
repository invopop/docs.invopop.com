## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Invopop is essentially a list of steps that are executed sequentially for an incoming _job_. Each step in a workflow is linked to a provider of a specific service, such as:

- generating a PDF,
- forwarding invoices to an external tax agency,
- modifying documents,
- sending emails,
- posting webhooks,
- forwarding documents to ERPs or other systems, etc.

Workflows allow you to automate and streamline processes related to document handling. Invopop handles the complexity of ensuring that every step is executed using retries and error handling.
