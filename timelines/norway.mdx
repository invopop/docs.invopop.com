</Update>

<Update label="1 Jan 2020" tags={["Norway"]}>
  **SAF-T Financial mandatory**<br />
  SAF-T Financial reporting becomes mandatory for all enterprises with a bookkeeping obligation that store accounting information electronically. Businesses with annual turnover below NOK 5 million are exempt unless their accounting data is already digital.
</Update>

<Update label="1 Jan 2022" tags={["Norway"]}>
  **New digital VAT return (mva-meldingen)**<br />
  The modernized VAT return replaces the old RF-0002 form. The new return has 30 reporting codes (vs. 19 previously), directly aligned with SAF-T standard tax codes, and must be submitted electronically via Altinn or ERP API.
</Update>

<Update label="1 Jan 2025" tags={["Norway"]}>
  **SAF-T Financial v1.30 mandatory**<br />
  Version 1.30 of SAF-T Financial becomes mandatory, introducing significant changes: removal of standard chart-of-accounts mapping (replaced by `GroupingCategory` and `GroupingCode`), new balance account structures, new VAT presentation methods, and previously voluntary elements becoming mandatory. Version 1.20 remains valid for financial year 2024 and earlier.
</Update>

<Update label="1 Jan 2028" tags={["B2B", "Norway"]}>
  **Mandatory B2B e-invoice sending (proposed)**<br />
  The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has proposed that all businesses with bookkeeping obligations must send e-invoices in PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 format to recipients registered in ELMA. Consultation closed 31 October 2025 — final legislative decision pending.

  <Warning>This date is proposed, not yet confirmed in law.</Warning>
</Update>

<Update label="1 Jan 2030" tags={["B2B", "Norway", "EU"]}>
  **Mandatory B2B e-invoice receiving and digital bookkeeping (proposed)**<br />
  All businesses with bookkeeping obligations would also be required to receive e-invoices and maintain digital bookkeeping systems. This aligns with the EU's ViDA cross-border deadline, reflecting Norway's deliberate alignment with European norms despite not being an EU member state.

  <Warning>This date is proposed, not yet confirmed in law.</Warning>
</Update>

<Update label="Future (tbd)" tags={["B2B", "EU"]}>
  **VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA)**<br />
  Norway is not directly bound by the EU's **VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA)** initiative (formally adopted 11 March 2025), but as an EEA member the directive is likely to be deemed EEA-relevant and incorporated via Joint Committee decision. Norway's proposed B2B mandate timeline is explicitly designed to align with ViDA's 2030 cross-border deadline.
