<Update label="1 Jan 2028" tags={["B2B", "Norway"]}>
  **Mandatory B2B e-invoice sending (proposed)**<br />
  The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has proposed that all businesses with bookkeeping obligations must send e-invoices in PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 format to recipients registered in ELMA. Consultation closed 31 October 2025 — final legislative decision pending.

  <Note>This date is proposed, not yet confirmed in law.</Note>
</Update>

<Update label="1 Jan 2030" tags={["B2B", "Norway", "EU"]}>
  **Mandatory B2B e-invoice receiving and digital bookkeeping (proposed)**<br />
  All businesses with bookkeeping obligations would also be required to receive e-invoices and maintain digital bookkeeping systems. This aligns with the EU's ViDA cross-border deadline, reflecting Norway's deliberate alignment with European norms despite not being an EU member state.

  <Note>This date is proposed, not yet confirmed in law.</Note>

<Update label="Future (tbd)" tags={["B2B", "EU"]}>
  **VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA)**<br />
  Norway is not directly bound by the EU's **VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA)** initiative (formally adopted 11 March 2025), but as an EEA member the directive is likely to be deemed EEA-relevant and incorporated via Joint Committee decision. Norway's proposed B2B mandate timeline is explicitly designed to align with ViDA's 2030 cross-border deadline.
