<Update label="Now" tags={["B2B", "B2G", "Denmark"]}>
  **Digital Bookkeeping Act — phased rollout in progress**<br />
  Denmark's 2022 Bookkeeping Act requires businesses to use certified digital bookkeeping systems capable of issuing and receiving structured e-invoices (PEPPOL BIS 3.0 and OIOUBL) and generating SAF-T files on demand.

  | Phase | Scope | Date |
  |-------|-------|------|
  | Phase 1 | Medium/large companies (classes B, C, D) using certified standard systems | 1 Jul 2024 |
  | Phase 2 | Same companies using custom/self-developed systems | 1 Jan 2025 |
  | Phase 3 | All businesses with turnover > DKK 300,000 for two consecutive years, incl. foreign entities with Danish VAT registration | 1 Jan 2026 |
  | Phase 4 | Remaining businesses using in-house developed systems | No earlier than 1 Jul 2026 |

</Update>

<Update label="15 May 2026" tags={["B2G", "Denmark"]}>
  **Updated OIOUBL validation rules mandatory**<br />
  Schematron validation rules v1.17 for OIOUBL 2.1 become mandatory for all B2G e-invoicing. This follows the January 2026 cancellation of OIOUBL 3.0, with Denmark now converging on a single PEPPOL-aligned standard.
</Update>

<Update label="≈ 2028" tags={["B2B", "Denmark"]}>
  **Domestic e-reporting obligation (estimate)**<br />
  Denmark is expected to introduce a domestic digital reporting requirement for B2B transactions, potentially replacing the annual VAT client listing. The Bookkeeping Act already authorizes the government to establish a common public data reception for e-documents, laying the groundwork for a future continuous transaction control (CTC) model.
</Update>

<Update label="Future (tbd)" tags={["B2B", "Denmark"]}>
  **Single unified PEPPOL-aligned format**<br />
  Following the cancellation of OIOUBL 3.0 in January 2026, Erhvervsstyrelsen is developing a single unified standard to replace the current dual-format landscape (OIOUBL 2.1 + PEPPOL BIS 3.0). This is likely to be based on PEPPOL PINT or a Danish National CIUS of EN 16931. Details and timelines will be published once the technical specification is finalized.
</Update>

<Update label="1 Jul 2030" tags={["B2B", "EU"]}>
  **VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) — cross-border e-invoicing**<br />
  The EU ViDA Directive (adopted March 2025) requires mandatory e-invoicing and digital reporting for all intra-EU B2B transactions. Denmark, as an EU member state, must comply by this date. This is expected to accelerate the introduction of a domestic B2B e-invoicing transmission mandate ahead of the deadline.
