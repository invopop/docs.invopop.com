		[KSeF](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse) (Krajowy System e-Faktur) 2.0 is Poland's mandatory national e-invoicing system operated by the [Ministry of Finance](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse). The system uses the FA(3) XML schema format for structured invoice data and provides real-time clearance for all B2B invoices.

		Electronic invoicing in Poland operates on a clearance model whereby every invoice must be validated against the FA(3) schema and business rules in real-time. Validated invoices receive a unique KSeF ID and official timestamp. The platform provides secure archiving for issued and received e-invoices.

		Invoices are encoded in FA(3), a strict XML format published and maintained by Polish tax authorities. The schema enforces standardized fields for both domestic and cross-border transactions, including buyer/seller data, VAT details, and item lines.

	**Key Features**

	* **Party Registration:** Register suppliers in the KSeF system with their Polish Tax ID (NIP).
	* **Workflow Automation:** Automated workflows for registering parties and issuing invoices through the KSeF 2.0 system.
	* **Real-Time Validation:** Every invoice is validated in real-time against the FA(3) schema and business rules, ensuring compliance with Polish e-invoicing regulations.
	* **Legally Compliant PDF Invoices:** Invoices are generated with all mandatory fields and FA(3) QR codes linked to the KSeF portal.
	* **FA(3) XML Generation:** Compliant XML generation is supported for the KSeF FA(3) schema.
	* **QR Code:** Generates the FA(3) QR code according to KSeF specifications.
	* **KSeF 2.0 Integration:** Direct integration with KSeF 2.0, Poland's official national platform for electronic invoicing.

	<Warning>
	  **Sandbox Only - Production Environment Not Yet Available**

	  KSeF 2.0 is currently only available in the sandbox environment. The production environment is expected to launch in February 2026 for large taxpayers.
