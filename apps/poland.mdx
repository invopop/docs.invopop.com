		[KSeF](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse) (Krajowy System e-Faktur) 2.0 is Poland's mandatory national e-invoicing system operated by the [Ministry of Finance](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse). The system uses the FA(3) XML schema format for structured invoice data and provides real-time clearance for all B2B invoices.

		Electronic invoicing in Poland operates on a clearance model whereby every invoice must be validated against the FA(3) schema and business rules in real-time. Validated invoices receive a unique KSeF ID and official timestamp. The platform provides secure archiving for issued and received e-invoices.

		Invoices are encoded in FA(3), a strict XML format published and maintained by Polish tax authorities. The schema enforces standardized fields for both domestic and cross-border transactions, including buyer/seller data, VAT details, and item lines.

	**Key Features**

	* **Party Registration:** Register suppliers in the KSeF system with their Polish Tax ID (NIP).
	* **API Certificate Upload:** Upload KSeF certificates, private keys, and passwords programmatically via API for automated integration.
	* **Workflow Automation:** Automated workflows for registering parties, issuing invoices, and importing received invoices through the KSeF 2.0 system.
	* **Real-Time Validation:** Every invoice is validated in real-time against the FA(3) schema and business rules, ensuring compliance with Polish e-invoicing regulations.
	* **Invoice Import & Sync:** Automatically poll KSeF for received invoices and import them into Invopop in GOBL format.
	* **Legally Compliant PDF Invoices:** Invoices are generated with all mandatory fields and FA(3) QR codes linked to the KSeF portal.
	* **FA(3) XML Generation:** Compliant XML generation is supported for the KSeF FA(3) schema.
	* **QR Code:** Generates the FA(3) QR code according to KSeF specifications.
	* **KSeF 2.0 Integration:** Direct integration with KSeF 2.0, Poland's official national platform for electronic invoicing.

	<Note>
	  **KSeF 2.0 Environment Support**

	  Invopop supports KSeF 2.0 in sandbox (test and demo modes) and production environments. In sandbox, you can choose between test mode (with automatically generated certificates) or demo mode (simulating the real production flow). In production, all suppliers are registered directly with the KSeF production system.
