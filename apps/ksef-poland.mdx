		[KSeF](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse) (Krajowy System e-Faktur) is Poland's official national platform for electronic invoicing, established and operated by the [Ministry of Finance](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse). KSeF with the FA_VAT format aims to increase transparency, streamline VAT compliance, and reduce tax fraud in business-to-business (B2B) invoicing.

		Electronic invoicing in Poland operates on a real-time validation model whereby every invoice must be validated against the FA_VAT schema and business rules. Validated invoices receive a unique KSeF ID and official 'receipt' timestamp. The platform provides secure archiving for issued and received e-invoices.

		Invoices are encoded in FA_VAT, a strict XML format published and maintained by Polish tax authorities. The schema enforces standardized fields for both domestic and cross-border transactions, including buyer/seller data, VAT details, and item lines.
