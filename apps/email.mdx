	The Email app allows you to send emails directly from your workflows, making it easy to deliver invoices, notifications, and other messages to customers, suppliers, or any other recipients. You can send emails with file attachments (such as PDF invoices or XML files) or without attachments for simple notifications.

	You can send emails from `Company name <email@invopop.com>` by simply connecting the Email app. If you wish to send emails from your own domain such as `Company Name <name@yourdomain.com>`, you can configure the app to use:

	- [Resend](https://resend.com) with a verified domain
	- [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com) with an authenticated domain
	- An SMTP server authorized to send emails from your domain (Gmail, iCloud, Amazon SES, Microsoft 365)

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** Send emails automatically as part of your invoice processing workflows, ensuring timely delivery to customers.
	* **File Attachments:** Automatically attach invoice PDFs, XML files, or other documents generated by your workflows.
	* **Template Variables:** Use dynamic template variables in email subjects and bodies to personalize messages for each recipient.
	* **Custom Variables:** Inject custom variables using job args for dynamic content like payment links or conditional text.
	* **Multiple Recipients:** Send to multiple recipients, including automatic customer email detection, BCC support, and custom reply-to addresses.
	* **File Compression:** Option to combine multiple attachments into a single ZIP file for easier delivery.
	* **Provider Flexibility:** Choose from Invopop's email service, Resend, Sendgrid, or your own SMTP server.

	Make sure to check out our [Email Guide](/guides/email) for instructions on how to configure senders, set up email providers, and customize your email templates.

		    Send a notification email.
		</Card>
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="Workflows">
		The Email app integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows. Typically, you'll add the `Send Email` step after you have issued an invoice via the corresponding tax authority and generated a PDF (if required). This ensures the necessary files are attached and that the invoice complies with local regulatory requirements.

		For simple notifications without attachments, you can use the `Notify via Email` action at any point in your workflow.

		See the [Email Guide](/guides/email) for detailed workflow setup instructions and configuration options.
