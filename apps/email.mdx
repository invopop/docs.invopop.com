- A [Sendgrid](https://resend.com) account with an [authenticated domain](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication)
- An SMTP server which is authorized to send emails from your domain ([Gmail](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en), [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102525), [Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-smtp.html))

<Accordion title="Is Email in Sandbox limited in any way?">

We strive to make our sandbox workspaces as similar to our live workspaces as possible. However, in order to prevent abuse and email mistakes, the following differences should be observed in Sandbox:

* Emailing customers is disabled in sandbox workspaces.
* Emailing suppliers is disabled in sandbox workspaces.
* Invoice PDFs will have a "Sample" watermark.
* `[Invopop Test]` will be prepended to the subject.

<Accordion title="How do I set up Gmail as my SMTP server">
Follow [the instructions in this support guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en). Setting up an SMTP relay allows you more fine-grained control over your email needs and has the largest quota (up to 10,000 recipients per day); but can only be set up by an account administrator.

Gmail's SMTP server allows up to 2,000 emails per day. It can be set up by an end-user by creating an [app password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833) and using the set-up configuration listed in the Google support guide.
