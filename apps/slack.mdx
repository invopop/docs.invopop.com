Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. For instance, you might want to receive a message when one of your job executions fails: 

<Frame caption="Example workflow with Slack"><img src="/guides/images/slack-workflow.png" /></Frame>

In this example, you will receive in your Slack channel `#random` a message like `Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!` when the PDF generation fails.

## Prerequisites

You require Slack account with full membership or an admin role within a workspace.

## How to use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Slack App">
    To configure the Slack app in your workspace, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**.
    2. Find the Slack App and click `Connect`.
    3. Click `Configure` and then `Add Slack Channel`.
    4. In the newly opened window, select the channel where you want to send messages.

    After you have selected a channel, you will be redirected back to the Invopop console, where you should see a message that says “Authorized and connected to:” followed by the list of channels that you are connected to. This confirms that the connection was successful.

    In case you want to connect more channels, click the "Add Slack Channel" and connect the new one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Slack step to your workflows">
    To use the Slack step in your workflows, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the Workflows section and select the workflow you want to modify.
    2. Add the Slack step to your workflow.
    3. Select the Slack channel where you want to send messages.
    4. Customize the message content as needed.

  <Tab title="FAQ">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Can I route messages to different channels based on severity?">
        Yes. Each Slack action can specify a static channel or derive one dynamically with an expression (e.g. `channel: "{{ severity == 'error' ? '#ops-alerts' : '#invoices-stream' }}"`).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Are attachments or files supported?">
        Yes. An action can include file references (PDF, XML) already present in the Silo Entry; links show up as contextual buttons or attachments.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How are approvals secured?">
        Button interactions are signed and mapped to workspace members; audit logs record approver, timestamp, and resulting state change.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What happens if Slack is unreachable?">
        Messages are queued with exponential backoff. After max retries, a workflow error is raised and can trigger an alternative channel (email).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Can I post to user DMs?">
        Yes. Provide `user:` identifiers (mapped via email) or use escalation action to target on-call rotations.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How do I prevent notification noise?">
        Use template-level conditional fields (e.g. only include totals for invoices above a threshold) and separate success vs error channels.
      </Accordion>
