	Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. For instance, you might want to receive a message when one of your job executions fails, or get notified when invoices are successfully processed.

	You can connect multiple Slack channels to your workspace, allowing you to send notifications to different teams or departments based on your workflow requirements.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** Send automated notifications to Slack channels as part of your document processing workflows.
	* **Multiple Channel Support:** Connect and send messages to multiple Slack channels from a single workspace.
	* **Error Notifications:** Get real-time alerts when workflow steps fail, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues.
	* **Custom Messages:** Customize message content to include relevant information about your document processing jobs.
	* **Easy Integration:** Simple setup process that requires only a Slack account with full membership or admin role.

	Make sure to check out our [Slack Guide](/guides/slack) for instructions on how to configure channels and set up your workflows.

	<Tab title="Workflows">
		The Slack app integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows. Typically, you'll add the `Send to Slack` step in your error handling flow to receive notifications when workflow steps fail, or in your main flow to notify your team about successful document processing.

		For example, you can add a Slack notification step in the error handling area of your workflow to receive messages like `Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!` when a step encounters an error.

		See the [Slack Guide](/guides/slack) for detailed setup instructions and configuration options.
