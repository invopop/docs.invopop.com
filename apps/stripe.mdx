	The Stripe integration allows you to automatically generate tax-compliant invoices and credit notes from your [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) dashboard. When a Stripe invoice or credit note reaches the [finalized status](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invoice-states), the integration automatically creates a new job in your selected Invopop workflow.

	The integration consists of two components:
	1. An Invopop app within your Stripe dashboard (installed from the [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/invopop))
	2. An app in your Invopop console

	The job will extract the invoice data from Stripe and execute the workflow actions, such as converting it to any e-invoice format and submitting it to your local tax authority.

	#### Key Features

	* **Automatic Import:** Finalized Stripe invoices and credit notes are automatically imported into Invopop and saved to the `Sales` folder.
	* **Workflow Automation:** Process imported invoices through your configured workflows to generate compliant invoices, PDFs, and submit to tax authorities.
	* **Real-Time Processing:** Track invoice status directly in your Stripe dashboard with the Invopop panel in the right sidebar.
	* **Historical Import:** Import historical invoices issued before connecting Invopop by clicking <kbd>Process this invoice</kbd> in the Stripe dashboard.
	* **Error Handling:** Retry failed imports directly from Stripe or troubleshoot in the Invopop console.
	* **Multi-Format Support:** Convert Stripe invoices to any e-invoice format supported by Invopop, including country-specific formats like VERI\*FACTU (Spain), XRechnung (Germany), and more.

	Make sure to check out our [Stripe Guide](/guides/stripe) for instructions on how to install the app, connect your accounts, configure workflows, and monitor invoice processing.
