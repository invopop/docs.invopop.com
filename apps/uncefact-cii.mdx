        **UN/CEFACT CII (Cross Industry Invoice)** is a key document within the family of Supply Chain "Cross-Industry" messages that are exchanged globally between trading partners.


        UN/CEFACT CII is part of a group of messages in supply chain procedures called the [Cross-Industry family of deliverables](https://unece.org/trade/documents/2008/11/brs-cross-industry-common-requirements) which are all based on the principle of a maximum data set, are integrated into the Supply Chain Reference Data Model, and are fully interoperable with each other.

        The standard has achieved significant adoption in Europe. UN/CEFACT CII was chosen in 2016 as one of two obligatory standards within the European Union for public procurement, meaning that every public agency within the EU, is obliged to accept this standard for electronic invoicing. The standard is typically implemented in XML format using the Supply Chain Reference Data Model (SCRDM).
