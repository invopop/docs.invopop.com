		The [SDI](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it) (_Sistema di Interscambio_) is Italy's central hub for transmitting, validating, and delivering all electronic invoices throughout the country. It is managed by the Italian tax authority (_Agenzia delle Entrate_).

		Electronic invoicing is mandatory for all businesses in Italy. The SDI system operates using a standardized XML format called FatturaPA, which ensures all invoices contain the required information and comply with the strict validation rules established by the Italian tax authority.

		Invopop simplifies SDI integration by allowing you to work with GOBL format instead of XML, providing synchronous validation before submission, and offering a simple API integration with automatic handling of SDI notifications and status updates. Invopop has partnered with [A-Cube](https://www.acubeapi.com) to provide SDI integration services.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for sending and receiving invoices through the SDI system.
	* **FatturaPA XML Generation:** Automatically converts GOBL documents into compliant FatturaPA XML format.
	* **Real-Time Status Updates:** Automatically handles SDI notifications and status updates, including delivery confirmations and acceptance/rejection notifications.
	* **Bidirectional Support:** Send invoices to SDI and receive invoices from suppliers through the same app.
	* **Customer Registration:** Register companies to receive invoices through SDI with a simple workflow step.
	* **GOBL FatturaPA Integration:** Uses the open-source [GOBL FatturaPA](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.fatturapa) library for conversions.

	Make sure to check out our [SDI Italy Sending Guide](/guides/it-sdi-sending) and [SDI Italy Receiving Guide](/guides/it-sdi-receiving) for instructions on how to issue and receive invoices.
