The **SDI Italy app** (Sistema di Interscambio integration) enables fully digital transmission of Italian invoices in the mandated **FatturaPA XML** format.

It helps you:
1. Generate structurally valid FatturaPA XML from GOBL invoice data.
2. Apply required Italian regime mappings (e.g. Natura codes, Cassa Previdenziale, Bollo Virtuale).
3. Transmit documents to SDI and process asynchronous outcome notifications.
4. Handle corrections through credit notes or replacement invoices (there is no hard "cancel" after acceptance).
5. Produce a human-readable PDF representation with the original XML attached to the Silo Entry.
6. Track lifecycle: Prepared → Sent → Delivered → Accepted / Rejected.

<Info>
  SDI does not provide interactive real-time status APIs; outcomes are received as notifications (accepted, rejected, impossibility of delivery) which this app ingests and maps back to the document state.

<Tab title="FAQ">

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I cancel an SDI invoice after acceptance?">
No. Once SDI accepts an invoice it cannot be voided. Corrections must use a credit note (value adjustments) or a replacement (structural corrections).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Difference between credit note and replacement?">
A credit note adjusts amounts (vat base, totals). A replacement re-issues the document structure correcting identifiers or classification errors while superseding the original.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is delivery status determined?">
SDI emits a sequence of receipts: transmission acceptance, delivery to recipient channel (PEC / hub), or impossibility-of-delivery which still counts as valid fulfillment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need a recipient code?">
For B2B: use `CodiceDestinatario` (7-char) or PEC email; for B2G: mandated 6-digit office code. If unknown, fallback code `0000000` (recipient fetches from portal).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are VAT exemptions handled?">
Provide `nature` codes (N1..N6) in GOBL tax lines. The app maps them to FatturaPA `<Natura>` plus required reason text when mandated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What triggers Imposta di Bollo Virtuale?">
Invoices without VAT and above threshold (e.g. €77.47) typically require virtual stamp. The app can auto-flag based on totals & tax emptiness.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long are documents archived?">
Regulatory retention is 10 years. The app stores XML + outcome receipts + PDF representation for compliant retention strategies.
