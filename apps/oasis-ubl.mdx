**Oasis UBL (Universal Business Language)** is an open library of standard electronic business documents and information models for supply chain, procurement, and transportation such as purchase orders, invoices, transport logistics and waybills. 

UBL is a royalty-free library of standard XML business documents supporting digitization of commercial and logistical processes for domestic and international supply chains. It was originally approved as an OASIS standard in 2004, making it one of the most mature and widely implemented OASIS standards.

UBL is designed to plug directly into existing business, legal, auditing, and records management practices, eliminating the re-keying of data and providing a comprehensive framework for electronic commerce. The standard is owned by [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ubl) and available to all, with no royalty fees.
