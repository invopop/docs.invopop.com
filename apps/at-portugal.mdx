		Invopop is an officially certified invoice provider in Portugal. Our **AT Portugal app** supports invoice, receipt and delivery note compliance with Portugal’s AT e-invoicing regulation. Automate supplier onboarding, SAF-T report generation, invoice generation with ATCUD, and more. This app enables businesses (and their suppliers) to issue invoices and other document types in accordance with Portuguese law.

	#### Key Features

	* **Workflow automation:** This app provides automated workflows for issuing invoices, onboarding suppliers, and managing fiscal submissions to the Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (AT).
	* **Legally compliant PDF documents:** Invoices, payments and delivery notes are generated with a certified ATCUD and QR codes, as required by the Portuguese tax legislation.
	* **SAF-T (PT):** The app makes workflow steps available to manage SAF-T (PT) entries for each supplier. You can generate a file to upload to the AT's portal or report in real-time.
	* **Supplier portal:** Suppliers can generate SAF-T PT reports and create authorized series via the [Supplier Portal](https://at-pt.invopop.com/portal).
	* **Supplier registration:** Automatic registration (no onboarding process) with a single workflow step.  
	* **White-label support:** Invoicing can be performed either under a client’s brand (white-label) or directly by the issuing organization, according to operational needs.

	Make sure to check out our [AT Portugal Guide](/guides/pt-at) for instructions on how to issue invoices and onboard suppliers.
