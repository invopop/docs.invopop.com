	[Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) is a subscription management and billing platform designed for businesses that rely on recurring revenue. It automates tasks like subscription billing, invoicing, payment processing, and revenue recognition.

	Invopop's Chargebee app lets you issue locally compliant electronic invoices and credit notes from Chargebee. The app subscribes to new incoming invoices and credit notes from Chargebee. When a new document is received, it'll be converted into GOBL and stored in your Invopop workspace. Once an invoice or credit note is stored, the app will create a job on the configured workflow.

	Any updates and, importantly, error messages will be posted to Chargebee automatically, in the comment section of the invoice or credit note. We also recommend configuring workflows to send notifications via Slack or email to ensure any issues can be addressed quickly.

	#### Key Features

	* **Automatic Import:** New invoices and credit notes from Chargebee are automatically imported into Invopop and converted to GOBL format.
	* **Workflow Automation:** Process imported invoices through your configured workflows to generate compliant invoices, PDFs, and submit to tax authorities.
	* **Real-Time Processing:** Track invoice status directly in Chargebee with automatic status updates posted as comments.
	* **Multi-Format Support:** Convert Chargebee invoices to any e-invoice format supported by Invopop, including country-specific formats like ZUGFeRD (Germany), XRechnung (Germany), and more.
	* **Custom Data Mapping:** Support for custom fields and metadata to map country-specific tax requirements and extensions.
	* **Error Handling:** Automatic error reporting back to Chargebee with detailed messages in invoice comments.

	Make sure to check out our [Chargebee Guide](/guides/chargebee) for instructions on how to connect the app, configure workflows, and set up webhooks.
