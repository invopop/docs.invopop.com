		Brazil has a variety of electronic tax documents that must be issued in different cases for various tax purposes. These include service invoices (NFS-e), product invoices (NF-e), and consumer invoices (NFC-e). Each document type is subject to variations from state to state and municipality to municipality, with each jurisdiction applying its own rules, formats, and APIs for issuing fiscal documents.

		Invopop's **Documentos Fiscais Eletrônicos** app provides a unified way to issue fiscal documents across all Brazilian states and over 2000 municipalities using GOBL. You can find [the full list of supported municipalities here](https://tecnospeed.com.br/plugdfe/nfse/#homologacao).

		Invopop has partnered with [PlugNotas](https://tecnospeed.com.br/plugdfe/) to issue electronic fiscal documents in Brazil. The integration handles the complexity of different state and municipal requirements, allowing you to issue documents through a single unified interface.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for issuing NFS-e and NFC-e documents through the Brazilian tax authorities.
	* **Multi-Jurisdiction Support:** Unified interface for issuing documents across all Brazilian states and over 2000 municipalities, each with their own rules and formats.
	* **Supplier Registration:** Secure supplier onboarding process with certificate-based authentication for issuing documents on behalf of suppliers.
	* **Legally Compliant Documents:** Documents are generated with all mandatory fields and tax calculations as required by Brazilian fiscal legislation.
	* **PlugNotas Integration:** Direct integration with PlugNotas, an authorized technology provider for Brazilian electronic fiscal documents.
	* **NFS-e and NFC-e Support:** Issue B2B and B2C invoices for service and consumer transactions.

	Make sure to check out our [Documentos Fiscais Eletrônicos Guide](/guides/br-dfe) for instructions on how to issue invoices, register suppliers, and set up your workflows.
