	#### Key Features

	* **Automatic Uploads:** Automatically upload invoice PDFs and other attachments to Google Drive as part of your workflows.
	* **Folder Selection:** Choose exactly which Google Drive folder to store your documents using the built-in folder picker.
	* **Workflow Integration:** Add the Google Drive step to any workflow to automatically store generated documents.
	* **Secure Authentication:** Connect your Google account securely through OAuth authentication.
