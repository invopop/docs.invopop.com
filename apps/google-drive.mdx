    The Google Drive app provides **workflow actions** for exporting a document
    (invoices, credit notes, corrective documents, etc.) and its related files to
    Drive on demand or as part of a scheduled archival process.

    <Info>
      This integration is designed to be stateless: Drive becomes a *distribution*
      & *archive* layer, while Invopop continues to be the authoritative source of truth.
    </Info>

    <h3>Typical Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Daily invoice exports</b> to a shared finance folder.</li>
      <li><b>Audit packs</b>: Structured bundles per fiscal period.</li>
      <li><b>Client access</b>: Share specific series folders externally.</li>
      <li><b>Long-term archive</b>: Move closed period documents to read-only Drive folders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Folder Path Templating</h3>
    Define a pattern like:
    <code>{year}/{month}/{series}/{code}</code>
    Tokens available:
    <ul>
      <li><code>{year}</code> – Issue date year (YYYY)</li>
      <li><code>{month}</code> – Issue date month (MM)</li>
      <li><code>{day}</code> – Issue date day (DD)</li>
      <li><code>{series}</code> – Document series</li>
      <li><code>{code}</code> – Document code/number</li>
      <li><code>{type}</code> – invoice | credit-note | corrective | etc.</li>
      <li><code>{currency}</code> – Currency code (e.g. EUR)</li>
    </ul>

    <Warning>
      Changing the folder template after many uploads can fragment exports. Prefer versioned root folders if restructuring.
