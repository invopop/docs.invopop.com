    The **ILYDA Greece app** provides workflow actions and document transformations required for compliance
    with Greek e-invoicing and bookkeeping reporting (myDATA) to AADE. It focuses on:

    1. Generating the necessary myDATA payload from a GOBL Invoice or Credit Note.
    2. Classifying revenue, VAT and withholding taxes into AADE (myDATA) types.
    3. Transmitting documents via the ILYDA intermediary and persisting response metadata.
    4. Handling cancellations and corrections (e.g. credit notes).
    5. Optional white-label operation if you issue on behalf of multiple Greek entities.

    <Info>
      This content is based on reasonable assumptions from public Greek e-invoicing practices. Adjust to your
      production needs once you install the app.
    </Info>

    <Tip>
      Add the addon <code>gr-mydata-v1</code> in your GOBL invoice envelope to trigger Greek-specific validations.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="When to use this app">
        Use it whenever you need to submit sales invoices, credit notes or cancellations to AADE and ensure they
        receive a MARK (unique acceptance code). The app also helps map your product/service lines to required
        AADE income classifications.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="White-label operation">
        If you operate for multiple Greek suppliers, first register each supplier entity (party) and run a
        registration workflow action so future transmissions carry the correct VAT and establishment data.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Data retention">
        Transmission responses, MARK codes, and classification summaries are stored as attachments or metadata
        on the Silo Entry for auditing and reconciliation.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="FAQ">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="What is myDATA?">
        myDATA is the Greek digital accounting and tax reporting system operated by AADE. Invoices and
        revenue data are transmitted electronically and assigned a unique MARK.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Do I need to classify lines?">
        Yes. Each revenue line must be associated with an AADE income classification; without it, transmission
        may fail or return warnings.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What is a MARK?">
        A MARK is the unique acceptance identifier returned by AADE upon successful document registration.
        Store it for audit and cancellation operations.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="When should I cancel vs credit note?">
        Use cancellation if the original invoice was invalid before delivery/acceptance.
        Use a credit note when adjusting economic value after the invoice is recognized by the customer.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Are PDFs mandatory?">
        AADE focuses on the electronic submission; PDFs are still useful for human-readable distribution and
        archiving, especially with summary and VAT breakdown.
