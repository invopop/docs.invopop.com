		The [IAPR](https://www.aade.gr/en) in Greece stands for _Independent Authority for Public Revenue_ (Ανεξάρτητη Αρχή Δημοσίων Εσόδων). It is the government agency responsible for managing tax collection and overseeing the myDATA platform, Greece's standardized electronic invoicing and bookkeeping system.

		The myDATA (My Digital Accounting and Tax Application) platform enables businesses to report invoices and accounting data in real time, ensuring compliance with Greek tax regulations. The system validates invoice data and assigns a unique identifier (MARK) to each transaction, automatically generating electronic accounting books.

		Invopop has partnered with [ILYDA](https://ilyda.gr) to issue invoices in Greece. Each supplier must be registered with ILYDA to issue invoices on their behalf. This involves authorizing ILYDA as an electronic invoicing provider in Taxisnet, declaring ILYDA as invoice issuer in myDATA, and signing a service provision agreement with ILYDA.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for issuing invoices and credit notes through the IAPR system via myDATA.
	* **Real-Time Reporting:** Every invoice is reported to myDATA in real time, ensuring compliance with Greek e-invoicing regulations.
	* **MARK Assignment:** Invoices receive a unique MARK (Μοναδικός Αριθμός Καταχώρησης) identifier from the IAPR system.
	* **ILYDA Integration:** Direct integration with ILYDA, an authorized technology provider for IAPR electronic invoicing.
	* **EN 16931 Compliance:** Compliant XML generation is supported for the Greek EN 16931 + CUIS schema.
	* **QR Code:** Generates the MyDATA QR code according to the IAPR specifications.
	* **White-Label:** the process allows issuance on behalf of clients (white-label) or directly as an organization, according to user needs.

	Make sure to check out our [myDATA & IAPR Guide](/guides/gr-iapr) for instructions on how to issue invoices and set up your workflows.
