    The **SW Sapien app** connects Invopop to [SW Sapien's](https://sw.com.mx/) Efisco service to bulk download CFDI documents from the SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria). Instead of managing sensitive eFirma certificates or building brittle web-scraping solutions, this app delegates the complexity of SAT authentication and download to a trusted third-party provider.

    <Note>
      This app handles CFDI **download** only. Once downloaded, each CFDI is passed to the [SAT Mexico app](/apps/sat-mexico) for conversion to [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) format via a separate workflow.
    </Note>

    #### Key features

    - **Bulk CFDI download:** Request and download CFDIs for a given date range, both issued and received, through SW Sapien's Efisco API.
    - **Automatic job dispatch:** For each downloaded CFDI, the app uploads the file and creates a workflow job that triggers the conversion process.
    - **Periodic execution:** Combine with the [Cron app](/apps/cron) to schedule automatic daily (or other interval) imports.
    - **Flexible document types:** Configure whether to import received invoices, issued invoices, or both.
    - **No sensitive certificate management:** Authentication with SAT is handled entirely by SW Sapien, so eFirma certificates never need to be stored in Invopop.

    Check out our [Mexico: Receiving invoices guide](/guides/mx-sat-receiving) for step-by-step setup instructions. The app also supports importing issued invoices; refer to the configuration options below for details.
