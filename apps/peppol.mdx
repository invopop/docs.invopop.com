      Exchange standardized business documents (invoices, credit notes, orders) via the Peppol network.
    </Card>

    The **Peppol app** enables secure, standards‑based transmission of electronic business documents across borders and industries.
    It streamlines onboarding, validates document structure (UBL / CII), manages participant identifiers (Peppol IDs), and
    handles network submission responses.

    </Frame>

    <strong>Key Features</strong>
    1. Participant Onboarding & Ownership: Upload proofs of authority to activate your Peppol sending identity.
    2. Standards Conversion: Transform internal GOBL envelopes into Peppol-compliant UBL, or UN/CEFACT CII where required.
    3. Validation & Enrichment: Automatic schema, profile (BIS), and business rule (BR / validation artefacts) checks.
    4. Secure Delivery: Submit invoices and credit notes to receivers through certified Access Points.
    5. Response Handling: Capture delivery receipts, errors, and acknowledgements; attach them to the originating entry.
    6. Multi-Regime Support: Handles variations in local Peppol BIS profiles (e.g. different country tax scenarios).
    7. Retry & Resubmission: Built‑in workflow pattern for transient network or AP failures.
    8. White-Label Capability: Act on behalf of multiple suppliers via distinct participant identifiers.

    <Info>
      Peppol defines business interoperability specifications (BIS). The app ensures your document matches the correct BIS profile
      before transmitting. Mismatches are surfaced early in the workflow.
    </Info>

    <strong>Supported Document Types (typical)</strong>
    - Invoice (BIS Billing 3.0)
    - Credit Note (as an invoice with negative amounts / credit semantic rules)
    - Dispatch Advice (optional future expansion)
    - Order & Order Response (planned)

    <strong>Core Identifiers</strong>
    - Peppol Participant ID: Structured as `<scheme>:<value>` (e.g. `0088:123456789`).
    - Document Profile ID: Specifies BIS variant (e.g. `urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017`).
    - Process ID: Correlates business flow (e.g. `urn:fdc:peppol.eu:poacc:billing:3`).

    <Tip>
      You can store multiple Peppol Participant IDs for different subsidiaries and select one dynamically during workflow execution.

  <Tab title="Actions">
    These workflow actions become available once the Peppol app is installed:

    <Card title="Prepare Peppol Document" icon="file-code" horizontal>

  <Tab title="Example Flow (Narrative)">
    Below is an example end‑to‑end scenario for sending a cross‑border invoice:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Upload Invoice">
        Create a Silo Entry with a GOBL Invoice object including supplier & customer tax IDs,
        currency, lines, VAT breakdown and regime hints (e.g. EU cross-border). Add the `peppol-v1`
        addon if your configuration uses optional Peppol extensions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Start Workflow">
        Trigger the Peppol Invoice Submission workflow passing the Silo Entry ID.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Validation">
        The workflow performs structural & business rule checks; if failures occur, the state is set
        to Error and a structured list of rule IDs is attached.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Serialization">
        A UBL XML (Invoice) document is generated and stored as an attachment. Namespace prefixes and
        profile IDs are injected automatically.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Transmission">
        The Access Point connection sends the document to the receiver's endpoint. A delivery receipt (signed)
        is attached, including a network message ID for audit tracing.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Archival">
        XML + receipt are moved to archival storage; a PDF (optional) is kept for internal reference.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Completion">
        Entry state switches to Sent. Related entries (e.g. credit notes) can later reference this invoice's UUID.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      If the receiver requires CII instead of UBL, the Generate CII step replaces Generate UBL seamlessly based on
      profile negotiation.

  <Tab title="FAQ">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Do I need a certified Access Point?">
        No, Invopop's Peppol app integrates with a certified Access Point for you. You only need to complete ownership verification.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Can I send credit notes?">
        Yes—model a credit note as a standard GOBL invoice with negative line amounts or using the credit note type; validation will map to Peppol semantics.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How are profiles selected?">
        The app infers required profile (Process & Document Type IDs) from regime + tax context, with manual override via workflow input variables.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Is UN/CEFACT CII supported?">
        Yes—if the receiver, jurisdiction or procurement platform mandates CII, the Generate CII action activates automatically.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What audit trail is stored?">
        Every transmission stores: timestamp, network message ID, participant IDs, hash of XML payload, and receipt signature metadata.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How to handle VAT edge cases?">
        Provide complete tax breakdown in the GOBL document; the app normalizes into UBL `TaxTotal` + `TaxSubtotal` structures.
