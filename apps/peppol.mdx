## Introduction

Invopop, as a certified provider in Portugal, allows you to issue fully-compliant tax documents and report them to the Autoridade Tribut√°ria e Aduaneira (AT). Using the AT Portugal app, you can generate PDFs with the correct signatures, ATCUD and QR codes for all your documents (invoices, transport documents, payments, etc.). You can also report them to the AT in batch via periodic SAF-T PT reports, or in real-time, using the AT web services.
