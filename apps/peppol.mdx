	[Peppol (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line)](https://peppol.org/) is a global network for electronic document exchange, widely adopted for e-invoicing across multiple countries. It provides a standardized protocol for companies to exchange business documents like invoices, credit notes, and purchase orders.

	The Peppol network is particularly popular in:

	- Nordic countries (Norway, Finland)
	- Asia-Pacific region (Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand)
	- Several EU countries for business-to-government invoicing (Germany, Italy, Croatia)

	Invopop allows you to send and receive documents through the Peppol network using a single integration while continuing to work with our [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org/introduction) format. The Peppol app is designed to only send and receive documents, while format-specific apps such as OASIS UBL or UN/CEFACT CII handle the generation and import of the appropriate files.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for sending and receiving invoices through the Peppol network.
	* **Bidirectional Communication:** Send invoices to Peppol participants and receive invoices from the network automatically.
	* **Party Registration:** Register companies (Peppol participants) with proof of ownership validation for regulatory compliance.
	* **Multiple Format Support:** Supports both UBL 3.0 (Peppol BIS Billing) and UN/CEFACT CII formats for maximum compatibility.
	* **GOBL Integration:** Seamlessly converts between GOBL format and Peppol-compliant formats, allowing you to work with a single data model.
	* **Participant ID Management:** Automatically derives Peppol participant IDs from VAT numbers or local business identifiers.
	* **Visibility Control:** Configure visibility levels (SMP, SML, Peppol Directory) to control your presence in the network.

	Make sure to check out our [Peppol Guide](/guides/peppol) for instructions on how to send and receive invoices and set up your workflows.

			<Accordion title="Peppol send invoice workflow">
			This workflow converts a GOBL document into the Peppol format and sends it to the network.
				<PeppolSendWorkflow />
				[Add to my workspace →](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=peppol-send)
			</Accordion>
			<Accordion title="Peppol receive invoice workflow">
			This workflow receives incoming documents from the Peppol network and converts them to the GOBL format.
				<PeppolReceiveWorkflow />

			<Accordion title="Peppol register party workflow">

			</Accordion>
			<Accordion title="Peppol unregister party workflow">
			This workflow revokes participant permissions to issue and receive documents.
				<PeppolUnregisterWorkflow />
				[Add to my workspace →](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=peppol-unregister)
			</Accordion>
			<Accordion title="Handling 'Receiver Not Found' Errors"> 

				If your job fails with a `KO` error status showing `receiver not found in the peppol network`, treat this the same as an invalid email address. As countries roll out their Peppol networks, you'll encounter a mix of registered and unregistered companies, so it's important to catch these issues early. Use the Peppol **Lookup Participant ID** step to validate the Peppol ID before sending anything to the network. We recommend to create a separate workflow for this validation and run it against customer's information. This will catch the error before creating the invoice.
