		The [DIAN](https://www.dian.gov.co/) in Colombia stands for _Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales_ (National Directorate of Taxes and Customs). It is the government agency responsible for managing and overseeing tax collection, customs operations, and facilitating international trade.

		Electronic invoicing in Colombia is mandatory and operates on a real-time clearance model whereby every invoice must receive a unique identifier called a CUFE (_Código Único de Factura Electrónica_) issued by the DIAN.

		Invopop has partnered with [Plemsi](https://plemsi.com) to issue invoices in Colombia (DIAN). You have the option of either using Invopop's Plemsi billing account or create your own and provide your own credentials.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for issuing invoices and credit notes through the DIAN system.
	* **Real-Time Clearance:** Every invoice receives a unique CUFE code from the DIAN in real-time, ensuring compliance with Colombian e-invoicing regulations.
	* **Legally Compliant PDF Invoices:** Invoices are generated with all mandatory fields and CUFE codes, as required by Colombian invoicing legislation.
	* **Plemsi Integration:** Direct integration with Plemsi, an authorized technology provider for DIAN electronic invoicing.
	* **UBL 2.1 generation:** Compliant XML generation is supported for the DIAN schema.
	* **QR Code:** Generates the DIAN QR code according to the DIAN specifications.
