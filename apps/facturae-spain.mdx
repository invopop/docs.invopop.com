   Invopop's **Facturae app** is designed to support fully compliant conversion from GOBL to Facturae 3.2.2 XML format. The generated XML invoice must be sent through the [FACe](https://face.gob.es/es) platform or SII. Each public body registers its [DIR3 codes](https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/ctt/verPestanaDescargas.htm?idIniciativa=dir3) identifying the accounting office, processing unit, and recipient office.

		**Facturae** is Spain’s official electronic invoicing format, defined and maintained by the Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital. It is an XML-based standard designed to ensure legally valid, structured e-invoices for business-to-government (B2G).

	#### Key Features

	1. **Generate Facturae invoices:** according to the Facturae 3.2.2 XML format.
	2. **Adds required XAdES signature:** Facturae invoices must be digitally signed using an XAdES XML signature

	#### FAQ

	<AccordionGroup>
		<Accordion title="How do I verify that the generated XML is valid?">
			The generated XML will be added to your silo entry as an attachment under the "files" tab with the file name `facturae.xml`. Upload this file to [FACe's online validator](https://face.gob.es/es/facturas/validar-visualizar-facturas) to verify its validity.
		</Accordion>
	  	<Accordion title="Is the invoice reported to the tax authority?">
				No, our Facturae app converts from GOBL to the Facturae format. You must report it to the AEAT through your ERP or through the [FACe](https://face.gob.es/es) platform.
