	Invopop's **Argentina app** provides comprehensive integration with ARCA (Agencia de Recaudación y Control Aduanero), Argentina's national tax and customs authority. This app streamlines compliance with Argentina's mandatory electronic invoicing system, enabling automated invoice submission, authorization, and reporting through ARCA's clearance model.

	**Key Features**

	1. **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for registering suppliers and issuing invoices through the ARCA system.
	2. **Real-Time Clearance:** Every invoice is submitted to ARCA for validation and receives a unique CAE (Código de Autorización Electrónico) code, ensuring compliance with Argentine e-invoicing regulations.
	3. **Multiple Invoice Types:** Support for Factura A (B2B), Factura B (B2C), Factura C (Monotributistas), and Factura E (Exports).
	4. **Supplier Registration & Verification:** Generate registration links where suppliers upload their certificates and sign agreements to enable invoice reporting.
	5. **PDF Generation:** Invoices are generated with all mandatory fields, CAE codes, and QR codes as required by Argentine invoicing legislation.
	6. **WSFE Integration:** Direct integration with ARCA's Web Services de Factura Electrónica for automated invoice submission and authorization.
	7. **Sequential Numbering:** Automatic invoice numbering management to maintain required sequential order by punto de venta (point of sale).

	Make sure to check out our [ARCA Supplier Onboarding guide](/guides/ar-arca-suppliers) and [ARCA Invoicing guide](/guides/ar-arca-invoices) for instructions on how to set up and use these actions in your workflows.
