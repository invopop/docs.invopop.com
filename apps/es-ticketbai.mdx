	**Key Features**

	1. **Workflow Automation:** this app makes several workflow actions available to issue invoices and onboard suppliers.
	2. **Legally compliant PDF invoices:** TicketBAI requires QR codes to consult the status of a document with the local tax agency. This app will automatically generate compliant PDF invoices.
	3. **TicketBAI XML generation:** this app will generate a legally compliant XML which is included as an attachment in the Silo Entry and sent to the tax agency when issuing an invoice.
	4. **White-Label:** the process allows issuance on behalf of clients (white-label) or directly as an organization, according to user needs.


	Make sure to check out our [TicketBAI implementation guide](/guides/countries/es-ticketbai) for instructions on how to issue invoices.
