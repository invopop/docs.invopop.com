      Issue certified Portuguese invoices, credit notes and transport documents directly through your Invopop workflows.
    </Card>

    Invopop's <strong>InvoiceXpress Portugal</strong> app provides a bridge between a universal GOBL invoice (regime <code>PT</code>) and the
    certified issuance requirements enforced by the Portuguese tax authority (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira - AT).

    <br /><br />
    <strong>Highlights</strong>

    1. <strong>Certified Issuance</strong> – Produce AT compliant invoices (Fatura), simplified invoices (Fatura Simplificada), credit notes (Nota de Crédito) and debit notes.
    2. <strong>Automatic Series Synchronization</strong> – Register and track document series required by Portuguese law.
    3. <strong>SAF‑T (PT) Support</strong> – Generate periodic SAF‑T export files for audit and archiving.
    4. <strong>Real-Time Status</strong> – Sync document statuses (issued, canceled, void, exported).
    5. <strong>Workflow Actions</strong> – Compose multi-step, resilient automation for invoice generation, submission and cancellation.
    6. <strong>Add‑on Metadata</strong> – Enrich GOBL documents with InvoiceXpress-specific fields (AT codes, QR references, hash chain).

    <Info>
      This content is illustrative: names of workflow actions, steps, and behaviors are suggested based on common Portuguese e‑invoice practices.
    </Info>

    <strong>When to use this app?</strong>
    Use it whenever you need legally valid, certified Portuguese commercial documents with automatic hash generation,
    AT mandated QR codes and the ability to export SAF‑T regularly without building low-level integrations yourself.

    <strong>Supported Document Types (suggested)</strong>
    - Invoice (Fatura)
    - Simplified Invoice (Fatura Simplificada)
    - Credit Note (Nota de Crédito)
    - Debit Note (Nota de Débito)
    - Transport / Delivery (Guia de Transporte)
    - Pro-forma (optional internal flow, not certified until converted)

      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    <Info>
      Hash chaining: Portuguese certified platforms often return a hash derived from prior documents. The app will
      persist chain metadata in the Silo Entry addons so subsequent corrections preserve audit link integrity.

  <Tab title="Example Documents">
    <AccordionGroup>

        Copy, adapt, and upload with the Create Entry endpoint, then send to the issuance workflow.

        ```
        Use negative line amounts to adjust totals; the platform will compute new certified hash.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cancellation">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Confirm Eligibility">
        Not all issued documents are cancelable. First run <strong>Sync InvoiceXpress Status</strong>. If status is
        already exported or part of a monthly closing, cancellation may be disallowed; prefer a credit note instead.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Execute Cancellation">
        Send the Silo Entry ID to a workflow containing the <strong>Cancel InvoiceXpress Document</strong> action.
        On success, state transitions to <code>Void</code> and hash chain notes are persisted.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Fallback Strategy">
        If cancellation fails with a business rule error, re-run a workflow issuing a <strong>credit-note</strong>
        referencing the original document, then leave the original unchanged.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAF-T Export">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Schedule">
        Create a monthly cron (external) or manual trigger that starts your SAF‑T workflow on the first day of each month
        for the previous period.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate File">
        The <strong>Generate SAF-T (PT) Export</strong> action collects all issued/canceled documents for the period and
        produces the XML archive attached to a new Silo Entry (type: <code>export</code>).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Audit & Archive">
        Optionally push the SAF‑T file to external storage (e.g. Google Drive app) or sign the envelope with a timestamping authority.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Info>
      Regular SAF‑T generation simplifies audits and ensures retention compliance (minimum legal retention periods apply).
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="FAQ">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Is a series required before issuing the first invoice?">
        Yes. Portuguese law mandates series identification. The app's <em>Register Series (PT)</em> action ensures a series exists.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Should I cancel or issue a credit note?">
        Prefer a credit note once the document has reached the customer or appears in period aggregation; cancellation is for early mistakes before distribution.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How are hashes handled?">
        The issuance action stores returned hash and prior hash reference in the add-on section to preserve the chain.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Do I need SAF-T every month?">
        While some businesses generate SAF‑T only on request, monthly exports reduce risk and accelerate audits.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What happens if VAT rates change mid-year?">
        Validation references effective rate tables by issue date; outdated codes fail the <em>Validate Portuguese Tax Data</em> step.
