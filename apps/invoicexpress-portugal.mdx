		Invopop's **InvoiceXpress Portugal app** is designed to support full compliance with Portugal’s AT e-invoicing regulation. Automate supplier onboarding, SAF-T report generation, invoice generation with ATCUD, and more. This app enables businesses (and their suppliers) to issue e-invoices in accordance with Portuguese law through InvoiceXpress.

	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** This app provides automated workflows for issuing invoices, onboarding suppliers, and managing fiscal submissions to the Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (AT).
	* **Legally Compliant PDF Invoices:** Invoices are generated with all mandatory fields and a certified ATCUD code, as required by the Portuguese invoicing legislation.
	* **SAF-T (PT) File Generation:** The app makes workflow steps available to manage SAF-T (PT) entries for each supplier.
	* **SAF-T supplier portal:** Suppliers can generate SAF-T PT reports via the [Supplier Portal](https://at-pt.invopop.com/portal).
	* **Supplier Registration:** Automatic registration (no onboarding process) with a single workflow step.  
	* **White-Label Support:** Invoicing can be performed either under a client’s brand (white-label) or directly by the issuing organization, according to operational needs.

	Make sure to check out our [InvoiceXpress Guide](/guides/countries/pt-invoicexpress) for instructions on how to issue invoices and onboard suppliers.
