<Note>We're progressively moving towards a country-based approach to our apps, which is why you will find these steps under the "Spain" app. You can expect our current TicketBAI and VERI\*FACTU functionality to be grouped under this app in the future. We will ensure no changes will be required for your existing workflows.</Note>

	Invopop's **Spain app** provides comprehensive integration with Spanish tax agencies, centralizing all compliance requirements for electronic invoicing and tax reporting in Spain. This unified app includes tax ID verification through the AEAT census, invoice reporting via SII (Suministro Inmediato de Información), and will progressively incorporate TicketBAI, VERI*FACTU, and other Spanish e-invoicing systems to provide a complete solution for Spanish tax compliance.

	**AEAT Lookup Key Features**

	1. **Tax ID verification:** Verify that NIF/CIF tax IDs exist in the AEAT census for both companies and individuals.
	2. **Name matching:** For individuals, confirm that the provided name matches the tax ID on record with AEAT.
	3. **Name normalization:** Automatically update party names to the official AEAT format, ensuring consistency across your system.
	4. **Workflow integration:** Add verification steps to both invoice and party workflows to validate data at the right time.
	5. **Flexible configuration:** Configure which parties to verify in invoice workflows (supplier, customer, or both).

	Make sure to check out our [Spanish Tax ID Lookup guide](/guides/es-lookup) for instructions on how to set up and use these verification steps in your workflows.

	**SII Key Features**

	1. **Workflow Automation:** This app makes several workflow actions available to report invoices and onboard suppliers.
	2. **SII Reporting:** Invoices are reported directly to the AEAT through the SII system API, ensuring compliance with Spanish tax reporting requirements for issued and received invoice registries (with [limitations](#limitations)).
	3. **Supplier Registration & Verification:** This app will generate a registration link where suppliers will upload their identity documents and sign an agreement to report invoices under their name (also available through the API).
	4. **White-Label:** The process allows reporting on behalf of clients (white-label) or directly as an organization, according to user needs.

	Make sure to check out our [SII Onboarding guide](/guides/es-sii-supplier) and [SII Invoicing guide](/guides/es-sii) for instructions on how to set up and use these actions in your workflows.

	<Tab title="Limitations">

	### SII Implementation Scope

	<Note>Our SII implementation is under active development and focuses on core functionality for the most common use cases. If these limitations affect your business requirements, please contact us to discuss your specific needs and our implementation roadmap.</Note>

	The current SII integration provides a foundational implementation covering the primary VAT registry books required for most businesses operating in Spain. Understanding what is and isn't supported will help you determine if this solution meets your compliance needs.

	#### Supported Registry Books

	We currently support the two most commonly used VAT registry books:

	- **Libro de Registro de Facturas Expedidas** (Issued Invoices Registry)
	- **Libro de Registro de Facturas Recibidas** (Received Invoices Registry) - [with specific limitations](#received-invoices-registry-limitations)

	#### Unsupported Registry Books

	The following VAT registry books are **not supported**:

	- **Libro de Registro de Bienes de Inversión** (Investment Goods Registry)
	- **Libro de Registro de Determinadas Operaciones Intracomunitarias** (Specific Intra-Community Operations Registry)
	- Other registries such as cash payments (*pagos en metálico*), travel agency operations (*operaciones de agencias de viajes*), etc.

	#### Received Invoices Limitations

	When reporting to the *Libro de Registro de Facturas Recibidas*, the following key limitations apply:

	1. **Deductible VAT matching:** The deductible VAT amount (*cuota deducible*) always equals the charged VAT amount (*cuota repercutida*). Invoices where the deductible VAT is lower than the charged VAT cannot be reported.

	2. **Investment goods flag:** Invoices cannot be marked as investment goods (*bienes de inversión*) within the received invoices registry.

	3. **Deduction period alignment:** The deduction period must match the settlement period. Deduction periods that differ from the liquidation periods cannot be specified.

	These represent the primary limitations in the current implementation.
