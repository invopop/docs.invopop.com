<Note>We're progressively moving towards a country-based approach to our apps, which is why you will find these steps under the "Spain" app. You can expect our current TicketBAI and VERI\*FACTU functionality to be grouped under this app in the future. We will ensure no changes will be required for your existing workflows.</Note>

	Invopop's **Spain app** includes our SII integration and enables you to verify Spanish tax IDs (NIF/CIF) and normalize party names using the AEAT (Spanish Tax Agency) census. This helps reduce data-entry errors and invoice rejections by validating tax IDs before registering suppliers or issuing invoices.

	**Key Features**

	1. Spanish Tax IDs ([guide](/guides/es-lookup)):
		- **Tax ID verification:** Verify that NIF/CIF tax IDs exist in the AEAT census for both companies and individuals.
		- **Name matching:** For individuals, confirm that the provided name matches the tax ID on record with AEAT.
		- **Name normalization:** Automatically update party names to the official AEAT format, ensuring consistency across your system.
		- **Workflow integration:** Add verification steps to both invoice and party workflows to validate data at the right time.
		- **Flexible configuration:** Configure which parties to verify in invoice workflows (supplier, customer, or both).

	2. SII ([Invoicing guide](/guides/es-sii) | [Suppliers guide](/guides/es-sii-suppliers)):
		- **Record Invoices:** send invoices to the Spanish tax authorities using the SII system.
		- **Supplier Registration & Verification:** this app will generate a registration link where suppliers will upload their identity documents and sign an agreement to issue invoices under their name.

	Make sure to check out our  for instructions on how to set up and use these verification steps in your workflows.
