<Note>We're progressively moving towards a country-based approach to our apps, which is why you will find these steps under the "Spain" app. You can expect our current TicketBAI and VERI*FACTU (and upcoming SII) functionality to be grouped under this app in the future. We will ensure no changes will be required for your existing workflows.</Note>

	Invopop's **Spain app** enables you to verify Spanish tax IDs (NIF/CIF) and normalize party names using the AEAT (Spanish Tax Agency) census. This helps reduce data-entry errors and invoice rejections by validating tax IDs before registering suppliers or issuing invoices.

	**Key Features**

	1. **Tax ID verification:** Verify that NIF/CIF tax IDs exist in the AEAT census for both companies and individuals.
	2. **Name matching:** For individuals, confirm that the provided name matches the tax ID on record with AEAT.
	3. **Name normalization:** Automatically update party names to the official AEAT format, ensuring consistency across your system.
	4. **Workflow integration:** Add verification steps to both invoice and party workflows to validate data at the right time.
	5. **Flexible configuration:** Configure which parties to verify in invoice workflows (supplier, customer, or both).

	Make sure to check out our [Spanish Tax ID Lookup guide](/guides/es-lookup) for instructions on how to set up and use these verification steps in your workflows.
