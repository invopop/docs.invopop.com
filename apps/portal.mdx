description: Convert a simplified invoice or receipt into a full invoice
---

**Portal** creates a link to a web page for your customers to fill in a form to supplement a simplified invoice or receipt with the information required to issue a full invoice. This is useful for businesses that want to issue invoices for customers that don't have a full set of information available, such as customers that are not yet registered in your system. A common workflow set up is registering minimal cusutomer information (e.g. email) and then allowing the customer to fill in the rest of the information on the web page.

## Key features

* Allow your customers to convert their simplified invoice or receipt into a full invoice by filling in a form.
* Configure the name and logo that will be displayed on the web page.
