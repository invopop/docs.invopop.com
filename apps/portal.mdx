	<Tab title="Description">
    **Portal** creates a link to a web page for your customers to fill in a form to supplement a simplified invoice or receipt with the information required to issue a full invoice. This is useful for businesses that want to issue invoices for customers that don't have a full set of information available, such as customers that are not yet registered in your system. A common workflow set up is registering minimal cusutomer information (e.g. email) and then allowing the customer to fill in the rest of the information on the web page.

    ## Key features

    * Allow your customers to replace their simplified (B2C) invoice or receipt into a full (B2B) invoice by filling in a form with their fiscal information.
    * Configure the name and logo that will be displayed on the web page.
