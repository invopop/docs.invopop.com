      Secure read & action surface for parties linked to your documents.
    </Card>

    The **Portal app** adds a self-service experience so your customers and suppliers can:
    - View invoices, credit notes, quotes and delivery notes
    - Download compliant PDFs & structured source (GOBL, XML, JSON)
    - Acknowledge, accept or dispute documents
    - Upload supporting attachments (e.g. purchase orders)
    - Pay an invoice (requires a payment app such as Stripe or Chargebee)
    - Subscribe to status notifications

    <Info>
      The Portal never exposes internal workflow metadata or private series sequencing logic. Each shared session is scoped to the party and limited to permitted document states.
    </Info>

    **Typical Use Cases**
    1. B2B invoice distribution without emailing raw attachments
    2. Quote acceptance & automated conversion into invoice/fulfilment workflow
    3. Supplier collaboration (upload shipping docs, update references)
    4. Audit-safe external access to originals (hash preserved)

    **Core Concepts**
    | Concept | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | Portal Session | Ephemeral scoped access issued via workflow action or API |
    | Share Token | Short-lived signed token embedded in the portal link |
    | Capabilities | Granular flags: `view`, `download`, `accept`, `pay`, `upload`, `dispute`, `comment` |
    | Expiry Policy | Default 30 days, configurable per workflow action |
    | Theme | Logo, colors and footer are inherited from Workspace settings |

    <Tip>
      Combine Portal actions with Notification apps (Email/Slack) to send branded share links automatically at document state transitions.
    </Tip>

  <Tab title="Actions">
    The Portal app contributes **workflow actions** you can insert into invoice, quote, credit note, or generic document workflows:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Generate Portal Link">
        Issues a signed share link for the target Silo Entry. Configuration:
        - Capabilities selection
        - Expiry (minutes / hours / days)
        - Single-use or multi-use
        Output variables:
        - `portal.link`: URL to send externally
        - `portal.expires_at`
        - `portal.token`
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Notify Portal Link">
        Sends the previously generated link to the related party using installed notification apps (Email, Slack). Supports templated subject & body referencing `portal.link`.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Wait for Acceptance">
        Suspends workflow until the external party clicks "Accept" in the Portal. Times out if expiry reached; can set fallback state.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Wait for Payment">
        Pauses execution until payment status is updated by a payment app (Stripe/Chargebee). Useful for conditional fulfilment steps.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Capture Supporting Files">
        Enables an upload dropzone in the Portal (e.g. purchase order PDF). Collected files are attached to the same Silo Entry and exposed in subsequent workflow steps as `attachments[]`.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Expire Portal Session">
        Immediately invalidates previously issued link, enforcing revocation (e.g. after dispute resolution or correction).
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Refresh Portal Snapshot">
        Regenerates rendered PDF/summary after the underlying GOBL envelope is modified, ensuring the external view is current without issuing a new link.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    <Info>
      For advanced control (bulk revocation, capability changes) use the API endpoints exposed by the Portal app (coming soon).

  <Tab title="Configuration">
    **Initial Setup**

    1. Install the Portal app in your workspace.
    2. Configure branding (logo, accent color) in *Configuration → Apps → Portal*.
    3. Optionally link a payment app (Stripe, Chargebee) to enable `pay` capability.
    4. Add workflow actions where external access is required.

    **Security Controls**
    - All links are signed and time-bound.
    - Single-use links invalidate after first session start.
    - Capability filtering ensures only permitted actions appear in UI.
    - Attachments virus scan (if enabled globally) runs before persisting.

    **Recommended Expiries**
    | Document Type | Suggested Expiry | Rationale |
    |---------------|------------------|-----------|
    | Invoice       | 30 days          | Enough for payment window |
    | Quote         | 14 days          | Drives timely acceptance |
    | Credit Note   | 60 days          | Extended audit visibility |
    | Supplier Pack | 7 days           | Encourages quick onboarding |

    <Tip>
      Use shorter expiries for sensitive or rapidly changing data; regenerate links via workflow if needed.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Monitoring">
    **Metrics (coming soon)**
    - Portal session count per day
    - Acceptance conversion rate (quotes → accepted)
    - Payment completion latency
    - Attachment upload failure ratio

    **Audit Log Entries**
    Each portal action generates an immutable log entry referencing the originating Silo Entry and Party.

  <Tab title="FAQ">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Can I revoke a Portal link early?">
        Yes: add the **Expire Portal Session** action to a corrective or dispute workflow, or call the Portal revoke endpoint (coming soon).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Does the Portal expose raw GOBL data?">
        Only if the `download` capability is enabled. Otherwise users see rendered summaries and PDFs.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How are payments handled?">
        The Portal delegates payment UI to the installed payment app; when the external provider confirms, a payment webhook updates the document state.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What happens after expiry?">
        Access attempts redirect to an invalid/expired page. You may generate a new link via a workflow action and notify the party again.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Is multi-language supported?">
        Portal inherits Workspace locale defaults; future releases will allow per-session language negotiation.
