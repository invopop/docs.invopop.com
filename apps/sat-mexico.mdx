    Invopop's **SAT Mexico app** enables full compliance with Mexico's CFDI e-invoicing framework. Use ready-made workflows to register suppliers, authorize the local PAC, and issue CFDI v4 invoices directly from Invopop. The app integrates with our local provider (SW Sapiens) to sign and stamp documents and deliver them to SAT.

    #### Key Features

    - **Workflow Automation:** The app makes workflow steps available for post-registration, supplier registration, and issuing invoices through SAT.
    - **PDF Generation:** Optional PDF creation with configurable layout, locale, and formatting.
    - **PAC authorization:** One-time e.firma (FIEL) sign-off to allow the PAC to stamp and submit CFDIs on your behalf.
    - **CFDI v4 compliance:** Validations and transformations powered by the GOBL library and the `mx-cfdi-v4` addon.
    - **Supplier onboarding:** Collect RFC and fiscal regime code; upload CSD (certificate & key) and activate via a secure registration link.
    - **White-Label Support:** Invoicing can be performed either under a client's brand (white-label) or directly by the issuing organization, according to operational needs. Make sure to check out our [SAT Mexico Guide](/guides/mx-sat) for instructions on how to issue invoices and onboard suppliers.
