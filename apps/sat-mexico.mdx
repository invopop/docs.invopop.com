    Invopop's **SAT Mexico app** enables full compliance with Mexico's CFDI e-invoicing framework. Use ready-made workflows to register suppliers, authorize the local PAC, and issue CFDI v4 invoices directly from Invopop. The app also provides CFDI import capabilities, converting CFDI XML documents to [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) format for use in accounts payable and other processing workflows.

    #### Key features

    - **Workflow automation:** The app makes workflow steps available for post-registration, supplier registration, issuing invoices, and importing CFDIs.
    - **CFDI import:** Convert CFDI XML documents to GOBL format. Combine with the [SW Sapien app](/apps/sw-sapien) to bulk download CFDIs from SAT.
    - **PDF generation:** Optional PDF creation with configurable layout, locale, and formatting.
    - **PAC authorization:** One-time e.firma (FIEL) sign-off to allow the PAC to stamp and submit CFDIs on your behalf.
    - **CFDI v4 compliance:** Validations and transformations powered by the GOBL library and the `mx-cfdi-v4` addon.
    - **Supplier onboarding:** Collect RFC and fiscal regime code; upload CSD (certificate & key) and activate via a secure registration link.
    - **White-label support:** Invoicing can be performed either under a client's brand (white-label) or directly by the issuing organization, according to operational needs.

    Check out our [Issuing invoices guide](/guides/mx-sat-issuing) for instructions on how to issue invoices and onboard suppliers, or the [Receiving invoices guide](/guides/mx-sat-receiving) for importing CFDIs.
