    7: **Oasis UBL (Universal Business Language)** is an open library of standard electronic business documents and information models for supply chain, procurement, and transportation such as purchase orders, invoices, transport logistics and waybills. 
    8  
    9  UBL is a royalty-free library of standard XML business documents supporting digitization of commercial and logistical processes for domestic and international supply chains. It was originally approved as an OASIS standard in 2004, making it one of the most mature and widely implemented OASIS standards.

   38: 	Invopop allows you to send and receive documents through the Peppol network using a single integration while continuing to work with our [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org/introduction) format. The Peppol app is designed to only send and receive documents, while format-specific apps such as Oasis UBL or UN/CEFACT CII handle the generation and import of the appropriate files.

   13  Colombia operates a mandatory e-invoicing through **DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)**, the national tax and customs authority. The system uses a **clearance model** (also known as continuous transaction control or CTC), where each invoice must be submitted to DIAN, digitally signed, and validated in real time before it becomes legally valid.
   14  
   15: The Colombian e-invoicing system centers on **FEV (Factura Electrónica de Venta)**, the official electronic invoice format used for B2B and B2G transactions. FEV has been mandatory for all B2B invoices since 2020 and uses the **OASIS UBL format** (UBL 2.1 DIAN schema). Since 2024, **Documento Equivalente Electrónico** has been required for B2C transactions, bringing retail and point-of-sale transactions under the electronic invoicing system as well.
   16  
   17  E-reporting in Colombia is fully integrated into the FEV system rather than being a separate process. Only upon validation is the invoice legally issued and reported to the tax authority, meaning **issuing the FEV automatically fulfills reporting obligations** without requiring separate periodic submissions.

   36  If you only want to _send_ invoices through Peppol, you can skip step 3 and 4 of the setup. Alternatively, if you only want to _receive_ invoices through Peppol, you can skip step 2.
   37  
   38: The Peppol app is designed to only send and receive the document, generating and importing the appropriate file is delegated to format specific apps such as Oasis UBL or UN/CEFACT CII. This is done to keep the Peppol app simple and focused on the Peppol protocol, while allowing you to use the format that best suits your needs.
