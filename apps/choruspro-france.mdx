Chorus Pro is a mandatory service provided by the French government for invoicing French public institutions. The platform allows businesses to upload invoices in multiple e-invoicing formats and track them throughout the French public administration process. All invoices to French public sector entities must be submitted through Chorus Pro.

The platform supports various e-invoicing formats including [Cross Industry Invoice (CII)](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/e-invoice), and implements the [European Norm 16931 (EN16931)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/European+Standard+and+Specifications) European standard for electronic invoicing with additional French-specific requirements.


	**Key Features**

	* **Workflow Automation:** Provides automated workflows for supplier registration and invoice submission to French public institutions through Chorus Pro.
	* **CII Format Generation:** Using the UN/CEFACT CII format with Chorus Pro V1 extensions ensures compliance with French B2G invoicing requirements.
	* **EN16931 Compliance:** Implements the European Norm 16931 standard with French-specific extensions including SIRET number validation and service codes for government departments.
	* **Supplier Registration:** Automated supplier registration workflow that generates unique registration links for suppliers to complete Chorus Pro authentication.
	* **Invoice Submission:** Direct submission of invoices to the Chorus Pro platform with CII XML generation and validation.
	* **Invoice Tracking:** Track invoice status using invoice identifiers (series plus code) in the Chorus Pro portal.
	* **Invoice Modification:** Supports modification and resubmission of invoices until they are accepted by the receiving French public institution.
