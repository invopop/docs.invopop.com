## Introduction

In the Basque Country businesses are required to use certified invoicing software that generates a unique TicketBAI QR code for each invoice. These codes facilitate the traceability of transactions and prevent the manipulation or deletion of invoices. The invoicing software must also create an XML file for each transaction, which is electronically signed and sent to the relevant provincial tax authority.

The TicketBAI app and its associated workflow actions allow you to  generate, send or cancel TicketBAI invoices. Please refer to the [TicketBAI guide](/guides/countries/es-ticketbai) for a step-by-step configuration process in your workflows.
