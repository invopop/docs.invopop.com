# Autolink internal References

When editing or reviewing a document, scan for mentions of API endpoints, methods, or feature names that exist elsewhere in the documentation. If a matching file exists, convert the mention into a hyperlink pointing to the correct path.


## Guidelines
- Link the **first instance** of a term or endpoint per section.
- Only use relative paths to the docs.
- Only use paths to files you find in [docs.json](mdc:docs.json)
- Use markdownn hyperlinks.
- Don’t add links to already hyperlinked terms or if the file doesn’t exist.
- If multiple similar matches are found, prefer the most specific match (e.g., POST over GET for creation actions).
