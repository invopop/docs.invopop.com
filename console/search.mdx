You can search for documents in your workspace clicking on the search field, or by typing <kbd>/</kbd> (slash) anywhere within the console. Doing this will bring up the search results panel.

## Search results

The **Search Results** command-based search modal displays all documents that match the search. When a term is entered into the search bar, the system retrieves and lists relevant documents. The interface is designed keyboard-friendly, so you can use the <kbd>▼</kbd> and <kbd>▲</kbd> arrow keys to navigate through the results and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the selected document.
