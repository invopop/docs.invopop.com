You can search for documents in your workspace clicking on the search field, or by typing `/` anywhere within the console. Doing this will bring up the search results panel.

## Search Results

The **Search Results** quasi-modal displays all documents that match the search. When a term is entered into the search bar, the system retrieves and lists relevant documents. The interface is designed keyboard-friendly, so you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the results and press Enter to open the selected document.
