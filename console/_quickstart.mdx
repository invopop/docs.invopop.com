## Creating a workflow

Now let's create your first workflow. We'll start with a simple workflow that generates a PDF invoice.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Console">
    Go back to the workspace by clicking on the **Workspaces** tab, selecting your workspace and clicking on **Go to Console** or simply opening a new tab in https://console.invopop.com.
    <Frame>
      <img
        alt= "Go to workspace"
        src="/assets/guides/start-back-to-workspace.gif"
        width="100%"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Workflows">
    Click on the **Workflows** on the left sidebar. You'll see a list of all the workflows in your workspace.

        src="/assets/guides/start-workflow-list-empty.png"
        width="100%"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workflow">
    Click on the **Create workflow** button on the top right corner. You'll see a list of template workflows that you can use to get started. 

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a template">
    Select the "PDF Invoice" template and click on **Load template**.
  </Step>
  <Step  title="Modify the workflow">
    Let's add a step that sets the Document state to `Sent` after the PDF is generated. Click on the **+** button below the top right corner and select **Set State** in the right sidebar.
    <Frame>
      <img
        alt= "Add Set State action"

        width="100%"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step  title="Configure the step">
    You should now see the configuration of the **Set State** step, otherwise click on the step you've just added. Select `Sent` in the **State** dropdown. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Publish">
    Click on the **Save Draft** button save your draft workflow. Now click on **Publish** so you can start using it in your workspace.  
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Uploading an invoice
Now let's upload an invoice to your workspace that we'll later send to the 'PDF Invoice' workflow. 
You can upload document manually from the Console or by using the API. 
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console">
  1. In the [Console](https://console.invopop.com), click on **Invoices** on the left sidebar.
  2. Click on the **New invoice** button on the top right corner. You'll be redirected to the document editor.
  3. The document editor has two modes: the _visual view_ and the _code view_. Switch to the code view by clicking on the toggle below the Save button.

  4. Copy the invoice example below and paste it in the code view.

  <Tab title="API">

    Use the [Create an Entry](api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) API endpoint with a request body that wraps your invoice in the required structure.

    Your request body should look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "content_type": "application/json",
      "data": {}
    }
    ```
    Populate the `data` field with your complete invoice object. You can use the example below:
