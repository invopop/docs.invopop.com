## When to edit documents

The most common reason to edit a document is to fix errors or mistakes in the data before submitting it to a tax authority. You might discover these issues during review, or they may come to light after a tax authority rejects the document.

<Warning>
Once a document has been issued or sent to a tax authority, you should not edit it directly. Instead, use the [correction workflow](/console/doc-correct) to issue a credit note, debit note, or corrective invoice.
</Warning>

## Understanding document validation

GOBL validates documents against a strict schema, which means you will rarely encounter validation errors during editing. When validation issues do occur, they typically indicate:

- Missing required fields
- Invalid data formats or values
- Schema mismatches

The document editor highlights these issues with visual indicators, making it easy to identify and fix problems before submission.

## Editing rejected documents

Most editing scenarios occur when a tax authority rejects a document. Common rejection reasons include:

- Incorrect tax identification numbers
- Dates outside the allowed range
- Missing or incorrect mandatory fields
- Calculation errors
- Formatting issues specific to the tax regime

## Removing signatures and stamps

To edit a signed or stamped document, you need to remove its signatures first. The console provides a straightforward way to do this:

1. Open the document you want to edit
2. Click the **Edit** button in the top-right corner
3. If the document has signatures or stamps, you'll see an option to remove them

</Frame>

<Info>
Removing signatures does not delete the original signed version. The system preserves the complete document history, including all signed and stamped versions.

## How editing works

When you remove signatures to edit a document, the system creates a new unsigned version behind the scenes. This process:

- Preserves the original signed or stamped document in the document's history
- Creates a new editable version that you can modify
- Maintains a complete audit trail of all document versions

You can then make the necessary corrections using the same editor interface used for creating documents. The editor supports both **Code view** and **Form view**, just like when creating new documents. For more details about the editor interface, see [Creating documents](/console/doc-create).

## After editing

Once you've made your corrections:

1. **Review your changes**: Use the editor's validation features to ensure the document is correct
2. **Build the document**: Click **Build** to validate the document against the GOBL schema and enrich it with calculated data
3. **Save the document**: Save your changes to store the updated version
4. **Resubmit**: Send the corrected document through your desired workflow to resubmit it to the tax authority

The system tracks all versions of the document, so you can always review the history and see what changed between versions.
