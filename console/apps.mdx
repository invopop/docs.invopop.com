Apps extend your workspace functionality by adding country-specific compliance features, document formats, notification services, storage integrations, and more. Each app provides specific capabilities that you can use in your workflows to process documents according to local regulations or integrate with external services.

## Getting started

In a freshly started workspace, no apps are enabled by default. You must enable apps before you can use their features in your workflows.

The apps list is divided into two sections:

- **Enabled apps**: Apps that are currently active in your workspace
- **Discover apps**: Available apps that you can enable

## Enabling an app

To enable an app, click on the **Enable** button. Once enabled, the app appears in the enabled apps section and becomes available for configuration.

## Configuring apps

After enabling an app, configure it with the necessary settings, credentials, or parameters required for it to function. Each app's configuration page provides specific instructions for the required settings.

<Tip>
Enable only the apps you need for your workflows. You can enable additional apps at any time as your requirements change.
