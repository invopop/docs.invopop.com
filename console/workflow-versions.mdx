## Understanding workflow versions

Workflow versions provide a complete history of your workflow changes and allow you to track which version was used for each job execution. When you create or modify a workflow, your changes are saved as a draft. A new version is only created when you publish the workflow.

This versioning system helps you:

- Track changes over time
- Identify which workflow version processed specific documents
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- Maintain a clear audit trail of workflow modifications

## Drafts vs. published versions

When you create a new workflow or save modifications to an existing one, your changes are saved as a draft. Drafts allow you to experiment and refine your workflow without affecting active job processing.

A new version is created only when you publish a workflow. Publishing makes the workflow active and available for processing new jobs. Each published version is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once published. This ensures that jobs processed with a specific version always use the exact workflow configuration that was active at that time.

## Viewing workflow versions

You can view all existing workflow versions in the workflow information sidepanel. This panel appears automatically when:

- You first open a workflow
- You click on the workflow's canvas area (when no steps are selected)

The sidepanel displays all versions in chronological order, with the most recent version at the top. Each version shows:

- Version number
- Publication date and time
- Whether it's the current active version

## Identifying workflow versions in job history

When you inspect a document's activity or job history, you can see the specific workflow version that was used to process that job. This information helps you:

- Debug issues by understanding which workflow configuration was active
- Track which version processed specific documents
- Correlate workflow changes with job outcomes

## Restoring previous versions

If you need to undo changes or revert to a previous workflow configuration, you can restore any previous version. This is useful when:

- Recent changes caused unexpected behavior
- You want to roll back to a known working configuration
- You need to compare different workflow versions

When viewing a previous version, it appears with a checkered background to visually distinguish it from the current version. This helps you understand that you're viewing historical workflow data.

### How to restore a version

1. Open the workflow information sidepanel
2. Select the version you want to restore
3. Click **Restore as Draft** to create a new draft based on that version
4. Review the restored workflow configuration
5. Make any additional changes if needed
6. Click **Publish** to create a new version

<Note>
Restoring a version creates a new draft, not a new version. You must publish the draft to create a new version that will be used for processing jobs.
</Note>

### Returning to the current version

If you're viewing a previous version and want to return to the latest version, click **Back to Vx (current)**, where "x" represents the current version number. This immediately switches your view back to the active workflow version.
