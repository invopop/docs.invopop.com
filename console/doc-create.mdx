### Creating a new document

After selecting **“New invoice”** from the previous screen, the application displays the invoice editor. This view has two modes: **Developer mode** and **Form view**, switchable using the toggle in the upper-right corner.


### Developer Mode

In Developer mode, the editor presents the invoice as a JSON document. This mode is intended for users who prefer to work directly with the underlying structure of the invoice.

* **JSON Editor:**
  The editor loads a minimal boilerplate invoice object. Any missing or incomplete fields are highlighted with red squiggles. These markers correspond to validation issues—either required fields that have not been filled in or values that do not meet schema rules.

* **Build Button:**
  The **Build** action validates the JSON against the defined GOBL schema. If the document is valid, the system enriches it with any required calculated or default data. You will only be able to save the invoice if the document is valid.

* **Error & Warning Drawer:**
  A collapsible drawer appears at the bottom of the screen. It lists any errors or warnings identified in the current document, including missing properties, invalid values, or schema mismatches. Each entry links directly to the relevant line in the JSON. The drawer can be hidden when not needed.

### Form View

Switching to Form view transforms the same data into a structured, user-friendly layout with input fields.

* **Invoice Section:**
  Fields for tax regime, series, and code are presented at the top, mirroring the top-level invoice properties in the JSON representation.

* **Lines Section:**
  Each line item is expanded into an editable form block. The quantity and nested item information—such as the item name—are entered through standard input fields.

* **Supplier Section:**
  Supplier details appear as a separate block. Name, tax identity code, and country code are displayed as individual fields, matching the structure of the `supplier` object in JSON.

Form view ensures that the same invoice can be created without interacting with raw code, while Developer mode gives full control to those who prefer manual editing.
