Document replication creates a new document based on an existing one. This is useful when you need to create similar documents without manually re-entering all the information.

When you replicate a document, the system creates a copy with:

- A new unique identifier (UUID)
- For invoices: the code removed and the issue date set to the current date
- All other data from the source document preserved

You can then modify the replicated document as needed before saving it.

## When to replicate documents

Replication saves time when creating documents that share most of their content with existing documents. Here are common scenarios where replication is helpful:


- **Recurring services with variable quantities.**
   For example, a maintenance contract where the base fee is identical each month, but hours or consumables change slightly.

- **Project-based billing with milestone repetitions.**
   When each phase of a project shares the same structure (same rate table, same tax logic), but the milestone description or amount evolves.

- **Rebilling expenses.**
   If you regularly pass through similar categories of expenses to a client—travel, software usage, subcontractors—reusing the previous expense invoice ensures consistent categorization and formatting.

- **Seasonal or cyclical orders.**
   Clients who reorder the same products periodically (quarterly restocking, annual service packages). The base invoice mirrors prior cycles; only dates or quantities shift.

- **Template for similar customers.**
   If several clients receive a comparable service package with minor price or detail differences, starting from a proven invoice avoids rebuilding the structure from scratch.

- **Ensuring continuity in complex tax setups.**
   In scenarios with multiple tax components or regime-specific rules, copying a previously validated invoice guarantees all those elements stay correct.


## How to replicate a document

</Frame>


1. Open the document you want to replicate
2. Click the **Replicate** button in the document actions menu
3. The system creates a new document with the same content
4. Edit the replicated document as needed
5. Save the new document

<Info>
The replicated document is independent from the source document. Changes you make to one do not affect the other.
</Info>

## After replication

Once you've replicated a document:

1. **Review the content** to make sure all relevant information from the source document is present.
2. **Update variable fields** such as quantities, dates, amounts, or other fields that need to change.
3. **Verify customer details** to make sure addresses, names, and tax IDs are correct.
4. **Build the document** to validate and enrich the document with calculated data.
5. **Save** the document or send it through your workflow.

<Tip>
Use replication to maintain consistency across similar documents while reducing manual data entry and the risk of errors.
