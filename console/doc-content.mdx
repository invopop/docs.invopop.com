## Introduction
Every document stored in the Invopop Console is represented internally by a signed GOBL Envelope plus companion data (files, activity logs, relationships, metadata, and signatures). The Document Content view lets you inspect the full lifecycle and structure of a document so you can:
- Verify integrity (signatures, hashes, states)
- Understand changes over time (activity timeline)
- Access generated artifacts (PDF, XML, JSON, regulatory payloads)
- Explore related documents (credit notes, corrections, substitutions)
- See enriched metadata (regime addons, workflow states, custom keys)

Use this page whenever you need to audit a document, debug a workflow result, or prepare regulatory / customer inquiries.

## Envelope
Envelope wraps around a document adding headers and digital signatures.

### JSON Schema ID
Schema identifies the schema that should be used to understand this document

### Header
Details on what the contents are.

### Document
The data inside the envelope.

### Signatures
JSON Web Signatures of the header.

#### Files
The Files tab lists generated or attached artifacts:
Common File Types:
- PDF: Human-readable rendition (may include mandatory QR, stamp, legends).
- XML / Structured: Regulatory submission payloads (FacturaE, FatturaPA, KSeF FA(2), CFDI, UBL, CII).
- JSON: Original or transformed GOBL snapshot.
- Auxiliary: Attachments (agreement, identity docs, shipping notes, images).
- Signature logs or hash chains.

Metadata shown often includes size, checksum (SHA256), creation timestamps, and MIME type. Use checksums to verify external copies match stored originals.

Workflow Interactions:
- Generation steps (e.g. “Generate PDF”, “Generate VERI*FACTU XML”) append files.
- Cancellation / correction workflows may add new XML replacing or referencing prior versions.
- Archival workflows create summarized CSV/SAF-T exports and attach them.

Retention:
- Files are immutable once attached; regeneration creates a new file or updates version counters (depending on workflow design).
- Never delete compliance artifacts—retain for audit lifetimes (often 5–10 years).

#### Activity
A chronological log of significant actions affecting the document:
Common Events:
- Creation (entry uploaded)
- Workflow job started / completed / errored
- State transitions (Draft → Sent → Paid / Void / Error)
- Signature applied or verified
- Attachment added
- External submission (e.g. SDI, AEAT, PAC, KSeF)
- Cancellation or correction accepted
- Reconciliation (payment posted)

Use Activity to debug failed workflows:
- Inspect failed step name and error code.
- Identify if a retry subsequently succeeded.
- Confirm ordering for chained regimes (e.g. hash chain continuity, sequence increments).

Audit Integrity:
- Each event is timestamped (UTC) and references the job/workflow ID.
- Non-destructive: Past events remain even after corrections.

#### Related
Lists documents logically connected to the current envelope:
Typical Relations:
- Credit note referencing an invoice.
- Corrective invoice replacing an original.
- Payment complement tying to issued invoice (CFDI).
- Replacement sequence (substitution under specific regimes).
- Cancellation or void record linked to original document.

Best Practices:
- Always navigate to related documents to confirm both halves of a correction or refund are consistent.
- Use related view to bulk export a chain (original + adjustments + replacements) for external audits.

#### Meta
Structured metadata and key-value pairs attached to the envelope that provide enhanced context:
Examples:
- Regime Addons: `es-verifactu-v1`, `pt-invoicexpress-v1`.
- Submission Protocols: `submission.protocol`, `ksef.hash`, `cfdi.uuid`.
- Signature Fingerprints: `signature.sha256`, `chain.previous_hash`.
- Workflow Tracking: `workflow.id`, `job.id`, `attempt`.
- Payment Resolution: `payment.status`, `payment.last_checked`.
- Custom Business Fields: department code, cost center, channel.

Usage:
- Workflows read/write meta fields to govern conditional logic (e.g. skip generation if `pdf.generated == true`).
- API clients can filter entries by meta values for reporting.

Guidelines:
- Keep keys namespaced to avoid collisions (`verifactu.*`, `ksef.*`, `cfdi.*`, `custom.*`).
- Avoid overwriting critical regulatory fields—append new versions or maintain snapshots.

### Signatures
Signature blocks attest to document integrity and authenticity. Depending on regime and workflow:
Contents:
- Signer identity (certificate thumbprint, key ID).
- Timestamp at signing.
- Hash or digest algorithm (e.g. SHA256).
- Envelope canonicalization details.
- Previous hash (for chaining sequences or regulatory chain requirements).
- Optional signature version or compliance profile.

Verification:
- Console may display a validity indicator (✔ Valid / ⚠ Warning / ✖ Invalid).
- Invalid signatures often result from post-sign modification of core fields or mismatched hashing algorithm settings.

Chain Integrity:
- For regimes requiring chained documents (Portugal hash chain, VERI*FACTU request chain, Brazilian NF-e sequences), each signature references the preceding hash to prevent tampering.
- Cancellations and corrections may generate new signature entries, preserving prior ones.

Best Practices:
- Sign after finalizing monetary and tax details.
- Regenerate PDF only after signature (so signature metadata can appear in the rendered document footer/header if required).
- For multi-sign flows (organization + intermediary) ensure ordering is consistent; verify both before submission.

### Quick Troubleshooting Guide
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Totals mismatch | Line rounding vs tax calculation inconsistency | Recompute sums; ensure currency precision matches regime defaults. |
| Missing PDF | Workflow skipped Render step | Trigger a regeneration workflow; check if a condition prevented generation. |
| Signature invalid | Envelope mutated post-sign | Re-sign with updated envelope; avoid editing signed fields directly. |
| Missing related credit note | Credit workflow failed | Inspect Activity for failed job; re-run correction workflow. |
| Protocol absent | Submission workflow incomplete | Confirm external API connectivity; retry transmission step. |

### Recommended Review Flow
1. Open Header: confirm type, regime, series/code, state.
2. Inspect Signatures: validate all present and valid.
3. Review Meta: ensure protocol/UUID and tax chain metadata.
4. Check Files: required artifacts (PDF + submission XML) present.
5. Scan Activity: look for errors or retries.
6. Inspect Related: confirm corrections or cancellations linked.
7. Export or archive if the document reached terminal state (Sent, Paid, Void, Corrected, Archived).

### Glossary
- Envelope: Structured wrapper for the business document and signatures.
- Addon: Extension enabling regime-specific transformations.
- Protocol / UUID / Hash: External authority identifier proving successful submission.
- Preceding: Reference block pointing to an original or prior document.
- Chain: Sequential cryptographic linkage between documents for integrity.
