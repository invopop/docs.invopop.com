    Invopop's **SAT Mexico app** enables full compliance with Mexico's CFDI e-invociing framework. Use ready-made workflows to register suppliers, authorize the local PAC, and issue CFDI v4 invoices directly from Invopop. The app integrates with out local provider (SW Sapiens) to sign and stamp documents and deliver them to SAT.

    #### Key Features

    - **Workflow Automation:** The app makes workflow steps available for post-registration, supplier registration, and issuing invoices through SAT.
    - **PDF Generation:** Optional PDF creation with configurable layout, locale, and formatting.
    - **PAC authorization:** One-time e.firma (FIEL) sign-off to allow the PAC to stamp and submit CFDIs on your behalf.
    - **CFDI v4 compliance:** Validations and transformations powered by the GOBL library and the mx-cfdi-v4 addon.
    - Supplier onboarding: Collect RFC and fiscal regime code; upload CSD (certificate & key) and activate via a secure registration link.
    - **White-Label Support:** Invoicing can be performed either under a client’s brand (white-label) or directly by the issuing organization, according to operational needs. Make sure to check out our [SAT Mexico Guide](sat-mexico-guide) for instructions on how to issue invoices and onboard suppliers.

  <Tab title="Configuration">
    #### Post registration workflow

    Create a simple post registration that marks suppliers as **Registered**. Select it in the SAT (Mexico) app configuration so suppliers move to the correct state after onboarding.

    **Connect the SAT Mexico app** in **Configuration**

    go to Apps, connect SAT Mexico and then Configure:

    - **Environment:** Sandbox/Live
    - **Post-registration workflow:** Choose the one you created above

    <Note>
      **Notes**

      - Instructions apply to both and CSDs are already pre-registered (you can also upload your own).
      - You'll authorize the local PAC later with your **e.firma (FIEL).**

    The following templates help you get started quickly. Use them as is or as a base for your own flows.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="SAT Mexico post-registration">
        - **Purpose:** Move suppliers to the `registered` state after successful onboarding.
        - **What it does:** Sets the supplier state to **Registered** (you can extend it with webhooks or notifications).

          <IssueInvoice />
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="SAT Mexico register supplier">
        - **Purpose:** Register a supplier to issue CFDI compliant e-invoices on their behalf.
        - **What it does:** Closes the envelope, **registers the SAT issuer (Mexico)** to create a secure registration link, and sets the supplier state to **Processing**.
        - **Outcome:** The supplier (or your ops team) uses the generated link to upload the CSD (`.crt` & `.key`) and password. Once saved, details are securely sent to the PAC.

        <RegisterSupplier />
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="SAT Mexico issue invoice">
        - **Purpose:** Issue a CFDI through SAT with optional PDF generation.

        - **Recommendation:** Use layout **Letter** and locale **es** for PDFs; handle **Error** states by setting the state to **Error** in the rescue path.

        <PostRegistration />
      </Accordion>
