title: "Sign Envelope"
description: Prevent further changes to the document
---

## Overview

Signing and envelope will add a digital sigunature and prevent further changes to the document, and is required by some tax authorities before issuing an invoice. Once you have signed an envelope it will raise an error if you attempt to modify its contents, preventing you from accidentally overwriting data.

## How to use

This workflow action does not require configuration. We recommend adding this step before sending to the tax authority.
