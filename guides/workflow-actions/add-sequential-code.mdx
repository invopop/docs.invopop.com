description: Assign a unique sequential code to your invoices
---

## Overview

Sequential codes are unique identifiers assigned to a document (usually an invoice) in a systematic, consecutive order. Most countries require sequential numbering for invoices as part of their tax compliance regulations. These codes are typically combination of both letters and numbers. 

This workflow action uses our robust [core sequence service](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/sequences/introduction) ensuring no invoice is skipped or duplicated. Our systems can receive a high volume of requests at the same time, and still reliably return numbers in series.

## Options

Select a sequence to use:

- **Existing sequence:** will list the sequences you have created beforehand through the API or in the Invopop Console.


- **Dynamic:** will allow you to configure a new series with the following options:
	- **Name (required):** to help you identify the series (e.g. _Invoice series_ or _Credit note series_).
	- **Prefix:** text to place before a generated code.
	- **Suffix:** text added after the series’ number.
	- **Padding:** width of the code’s number, with zero padding.
	- **Start:** the series’ last assigned number, zero, or the defined first index if no entries have been added yet.
	- **Sign document:** this will sign the document which will prevent further changes.

## Examples

A simple sequential code such as **INV0001**

| Property | Value          |
| -------- | ---------------|
| Name     | Invoice series |
| Prefix   | INV            |
| Suffix   | [empty]        |
| Padding  | 5              |
| Start    | 1              |

Prepend the year and append a city code singifying the company branch, and start the series at 023 because some inovices have already been issued: **2025-INV023-NYC**.

| Property | Value          |
| -------- | ---------------|
| Name     | NYC Invoices for 2025 |
| Prefix   | 2025-INV            |
| Suffix   | -NYC      |
| Padding  | 3             |
| Start    | 23              |
