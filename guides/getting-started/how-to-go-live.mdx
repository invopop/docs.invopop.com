        alt="Stripe screenshot"

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your production environment (Live Workspace)">
			Once you introduce your payment details on Stripe you will return to the billing accounts screen. Click on **Workspaces** (in the side menu), then on *New workspace*. Assign a name, select the **Live** type and the billing account you just created. Click *Create workspace*.
