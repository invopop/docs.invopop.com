## Goal of this tutorial

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand what invoice corrections are and when to use them.
2. Learn about the three main correction types: **credit notes**, **debit notes**, and **corrective documents**.
3. Explore different ways to issue a **credit note** to correct an invoice:
   * **Using the API**:
     * Upload a fully defined credit note
     * Auto-generate a credit note from an existing invoice
   * **Using the Invopop Console** to create the credit note through the interface.

## Understanding invoice corrections

When a previously issued invoice needs to be corrected, there are three main document types to choose from, depending on the nature of the correction:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Credit Note">
**Use when**: You need to cancel or refund part or all of a previously issued invoice.

**Purpose**: Subtracts value from the original invoice (e.g., due to returned goods, overbilling, or a post-issue discount).

**How it works**: References the original invoice and includes negative line items or adjustments.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Debit Note">
**Use when**: You need to add missing costs or charges to a previously issued invoice.

**Purpose**: Adds value to the original invoice (e.g., for late fees, forgotten items, or additional services).

**How it works**: References the original invoice and includes new line items to complement it.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Corrective Document">
**Use when**: You need to fix factual or legal errors in the original invoice (e.g., wrong tax rate, customer name).

**Purpose**: Adjusts details in the original invoice while keeping the reference for auditability.

**How it works**: Uses the `preceding` field to indicate the original invoice and provides corrected fields.

## Correcting Your First Invoice Using a Credit Note

Before we dive in, let’s quickly recap where we are.

If you’ve completed the [Quickstart tutorial](/guides/getting-started/quickstart), you should now have a processed invoice in your workspace. Great job getting this far!

Now, let’s imagine there was a mistake in that invoice and we need to cancel it. Since invoices submitted to GOBL are immutable, we can’t edit the original — instead, we’ll issue a **credit note** to correct it.

There are two ways to do this:

* From the **Invopop Console**
* Using the **API**

Let’s walk through both.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console">

  ### Steps
    1. In the [Console](https://console.invopop.com), click on **Invoices** in the left sidebar.
    2. Select the invoice you want to correct.  
      > Note: The invoice must be in the **Sent** state in order to create a correction.
    3. Click on the **Correct** button in the top-right corner. This will open the **Correction** dialog.

        width="550px"
      />
    </Frame>
    4. In the Series field, enter the series code for credit note:`CN`.
    5. Under **Type**, select `credit-note` from the dropdown.
    <Frame>
      <img
        alt= "Build invoice"
        src="/guides/images-tutorials/image2.png"
        width="550px"
      />
    </Frame>
    6. Click the Correct button at the bottom right of the dialog.
    This will generate the credit note based on the original invoice.
    7. Click the Save button in the top-right corner to store the credit note.
    You’ll be redirected to the invoice detail view.
    <Frame>
      <img
        alt= "Invoice detail"
        src="/guides/images-tutorials/image3.png"
        width="550px"
      />
    </Frame>

    You've just created your first credit note! You can click on Preview to see how it'd look like in a PDF format. 

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Upload of a Complete Credit Note">
        If you already have a complete credit note ready—whether written manually or generated elsewhere—you can upload it directly to Invopop.

        This method gives you full control over the contents of the credit note, including line items, taxes, and references to the original invoice.

        ### How it works

        Use the [`Create an Entry`](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-post) API endpoint with a request body that wraps your credit note in the required structure.

        Your request body should look like this:

        ```json
        {
          "content_type": "application/json",
          "key": "invoice-DEMO-001",
          "data": {}
        }
        ```
        Fill the `data` field with your full credit note object. Here’s an example based on the PDF invoice used earlier:

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Standard Credit Note">
            ```json
            {

        If successful, the response will return a `200 OK` status along with a JSON object representing the registered credit note. 

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Auto-Generate Credit Note from Invoice">

        Don’t have a fully defined credit note—or just don’t want to create one from scratch? Invopop has you covered.

        You can automatically generate a credit note by referencing the invoice you want to correct. All you need to provide is the **Silo Entry ID** of the original invoice and the type of correction you want to perform. Invopop will handle the rest.

        ### How it works

        Use the [`Create an Entry`](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-post) API endpoint with a simplified request body that tells Invopop to generate the credit note for you:

        ```json
        {
          "correct": { "type": "credit-note" },
          "previous_id": "silo_entry_id"
        }
        ````

        * `previous_id` should point to the Silo Entry ID of the original invoice.
        * `correct.type` should be `"credit-note"` to indicate the correction type.

        If successful, you'll receive a `200 OK` response with the generated credit note as a JSON object.
