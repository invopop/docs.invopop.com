## Prerequisites

Before issuing invoices, ensure you have:

- Completed the [ARCA Supplier onboarding guide](/guides/ar-arca-suppliers)
- Registered the point of sale(s) you want to use in ARCA (**production only**). See the [point of sales registration guide](/guides/ar-arca-suppliers#point-of-sales-punto-de-venta)

## Setup

Add a new workflow to your workspace for issuing invoices. You can start with the template below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Template">
    <Card title="ARCA invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=ar-invoice" cta="Add to my workspace">
      This workflow issues invoices in Argentina through ARCA.
    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code">
    <ArInvoiceWorkflow />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from scratch">
    Review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process before starting.

    In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow using the [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) template. Give it a descriptive name like "ARCA Invoice".

    Configure the workflow with these steps:

    1. **Set State** — Set to "Processing"
    2. **Send to ARCA** — Submits the invoice to ARCA and receives authorization
    3. **Generate PDF** — Creates a PDF with the ARCA authorization code (CAE) and QR code
    4. **Set State** — Set to "Sent"

    Add any additional steps you need, then save the workflow.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Keep the `Workflow ID` at hand. You'll use it later.

## Issue an invoice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload an invoice">
    Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload the invoice details. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field with these required fields:

    - Add the [`ar-arca-v4` addon](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/ar-arca-v4)
    - `series`: set to your point of sale (punto de venta) number
    - Do not set `code` (Invopop will assign it during authorization)

    <Warning>
      Do not sign your invoice before sending it to ARCA. The workflow assigns the invoice code and signs the document automatically during the **Send to ARCA** step.
    </Warning>

    <Info>
      ARCA requires invoices to be numbered sequentially without gaps. Invopop assigns the invoice `code` during the **Send to ARCA** workflow step based on the last issued invoice number.
    </Info>

    Choose the appropriate invoice type based on your tax classification and customer type:

    <ExampleAccordion />

    After uploading, you'll see the document in the **Invoices** section with status `Empty`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the invoice to the ARCA invoice workflow">
    Send the invoice to your ARCA workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: the Workflow ID of the _ARCA Invoice_ workflow you created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: the Silo Entry ID of the invoice you uploaded

    The invoice status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.

    You can verify that the PDF was generated by opening the invoice and selecting the PDF from the **Files** tab. The PDF includes the CAE and the required QR code.
