## Introduction

This guide explains how to issue invoices in Argentina through ARCA using Invopop's workflow system.

## Prerequisites

Before issuing invoices, ensure you have:

- Completed the [ARCA Supplier onboarding guide](/guides/ar-arca-suppliers)
- Registered the point of sale(s) you want to use in ARCA (**production only**). See the [point of sales registration guide](/guides/ar-arca-suppliers#point-of-sales-punto-de-venta)

## Setup

Create a new workflow for issuing invoices. Start with the template below:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Template">
    <Card title="ARCA invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=ar-invoice" cta="Add to my workspace">
      This workflow issues invoices in Argentina through ARCA.
    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code">
    <ArInvoiceWorkflow />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from scratch">
    Review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process before starting.

    In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow using the [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) template. Give it a descriptive name like "ARCA Invoice".

    Configure the workflow with these steps:

    1. **Set State** — Set to "Processing"
    2. **Send to ARCA** — Submits the invoice to ARCA and receives authorization
    3. **Generate PDF** — Creates a PDF with the ARCA authorization code (CAE) and QR code
    4. **Set State** — Set to "Sent"

    Add any additional steps you need, then save the workflow.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Issue an invoice

To issue an invoice through ARCA, your invoice must include the [`ar-arca-v4` addon](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/ar-arca-v4). Set the `series` field to your point of sale number, but **do not include a `code` value**.

### Sequential invoice numbering

ARCA requires all invoices to be numbered sequentially without gaps, as mandated by Argentine tax regulations. To ensure compliance, Invopop automatically assigns the invoice code during the **Send to ARCA** workflow step based on the last issued invoice number.

**Important**: Do not sign your invoice before sending it to ARCA. The workflow handles both code assignment and signing automatically when submitting to ARCA. The **Generate PDF** step then creates the final PDF including the ARCA authorization code (CAE) and QR code.

### Invoice examples

Choose the appropriate invoice type based on your tax classification and customer type:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Factura A - Registered taxpayer to registered taxpayer">
    Factura A is issued by registered taxpayers (Responsable Inscripto) to other registered taxpayers or monotributistas. This invoice type includes VAT broken down separately.

    <ArInvoiceA />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Factura B - Registered taxpayer to final consumer">
    Factura B is issued by registered taxpayers (Responsable Inscripto) to final consumers, exempt entities, non-categorized subjects, and foreign tourists. VAT is included in the total price.

    <ArInvoiceB />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Factura C - Monotributista invoice">
    Factura C is issued by monotributistas (simplified tax regime for small businesses and freelancers) to any type of customer. This invoice type does not break down VAT separately.

    <ArInvoiceC />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
