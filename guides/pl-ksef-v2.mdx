## Introduction

KSeF (Krajowy System e-Faktur) 2.0 is Poland's mandatory national e-invoicing system operated by the [Ministry of Finance](https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse). The system uses the FA(3) XML schema format for structured invoice data and provides real-time clearance for all B2B invoices.

Invoices are encoded in FA(3), a strict XML format that enforces standardized fields for domestic and cross-border transactions. The KSeF system validates all submitted invoices in real-time and assigns a unique KSeF ID upon successful clearance.

This guide covers two key processes:
- **Party Registration**: Registering suppliers in the KSeF system
- **Invoice Issuance**: Creating and sending FA(3) invoices through KSeF
- **Invoice Import**: Importing received invoices from KSeF

## Prerequisites

To issue invoices through KSeF, you will need:

- **For Invopop Sandbox - Test Mode**: Test Polish Tax ID (NIP). You can generate fake NIPs for testing at [http://generatory.it/](http://generatory.it/). In test mode, a self-signed certificate will be generated automatically, and you can start sending invoices immediately.
- **For Invopop Sandbox - Demo Mode**: Real Polish Tax ID (NIP) and credentials to access the [KSeF Demo Portal](https://ap-demo.ksef.mf.gov.pl/web/). Demo mode follows the same registration process as production but operates in the demo environment.
- **For Invopop Production** (when available): Valid company NIP and credentials to access the [KSeF Portal](https://ap.ksef.mf.gov.pl/). You will need to generate a certificate through the KSeF portal. Registration will automatically target the KSeF production environment.

## Setup

There are five key processes to prepare:
- Connect the Poland app
- Configure a party registration workflow
- Configure an invoice sending workflow
- Configure an invoice import workflow
- Configure an invoice sync workflow

All of the following steps must be carried out from the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com).

<Steps>

<Step title="Connect the Poland app">
  1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**
  2. Find **Poland** in the app discovery list
  3. Click **Connect** to activate

</Frame>

The initial connection requires no configuration.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure party registration workflow">

<Info>
  **Choosing Your Registration Environment and Polling Interval**

  When configuring the **Register Party in KSeF** step:

  **Environment Selection (Sandbox only)**:
  - In **sandbox**, you must select the environment:
    - **test**: Self-signed certificate generated automatically, no manual steps required
    - **demo**: Requires manual certificate generation from the demo portal (production-like process)
  - In **production**, no environment selection is needed—the workflow automatically registers suppliers in the KSeF production environment

  **Polling Interval (Both environments)**:
  - Configure how often Invopop checks KSeF for new received invoices
  - Options: **1 hour**, **1 day**, **1 week**, **1 month**, or **no polling** (disable automatic imports)
  - This interval determines when new invoices are automatically imported into Invopop

  If you want to test both sandbox modes, create two separate workflows with different configurations. For example: "KSeF Register Party (Test)" and "KSeF Register Party (Demo)".

</Step>

</Steps>

## Running

In this section, we'll provide details on how to register parties (suppliers) and issue invoices on their behalf.

### Register a Party for Test Environment

<Note>
  **When to use**: Choose test mode when you want to quickly test KSeF integration without dealing with real certificates or authentication. Perfect for development and automated testing.
</Note>

Test mode uses auto-generated self-signed certificates, allowing you to start sending invoices immediately without any manual certificate generation.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create the Party">

In the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com), navigate to **Parties** → **Suppliers** and click **+ New Supplier**.

Use fake Polish Tax IDs (NIP) generated from [http://generatory.it/](http://generatory.it/):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/party",
  "name": "Test Supplier Sp. z o.o.",
  "tax_id": {
    "country": "PL",
    "code": "9876543210"
  }
}
```

Click **Build**, ensure there are no errors, and click **Save**.

</Step>

<Step title="Run the Workflow">

On the party details page, click **Select Workflow**, choose your **KSeF Register Party (Test)** workflow, and click **Run Workflow**.

**That's it!** ✓ Registration completes automatically. The party is now in `Registered` state and ready to issue invoices.

</Step>

</Steps>

---

### Register a Party for Demo/Production Environment

<Note>
  **When to use**:
  - **Demo mode**: Test the complete production flow with real KSeF authentication in a safe demo environment (available in Invopop Sandbox)
  - **Production**: Live invoice issuance with real suppliers (available in Invopop Production)
</Note>

<Steps>

<Step title="Create the Party">

    Use real Polish Tax IDs (NIP) with access to the [KSeF Demo Portal](https://ap-demo.ksef.mf.gov.pl/web/) or [KSeF Portal](https://ksef.mf.gov.pl/):

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/party",
      "name": "Real Company Sp. z o.o.",
      "tax_id": {
        "country": "PL",
        "code": "1234567890"
      }
    }
    ```


Click **Build**, ensure there are no errors, and click **Save**.

</Step>

<Step title="Run the Workflow">

On the party details page, click **Select Workflow**:
- **For Demo**: Choose your **KSeF Register Party (Demo)** workflow
- **For Production**: Choose your **KSeF Register Party (Production)** workflow

Click **Run Workflow**. The party will be in `Processing` state until certificate upload is complete.

</Step>

<Step title="Access the Registration Link">

Get the registration link to begin certificate generation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your own company">
    In Console, go to the supplier entry → **Meta** tab → click the **gov-pl.invopop.com** link to launch the registration wizard.

    <Frame>
      <img
        width="398"
        src="/assets/guides/pl-meta-link.png"
        alt="Supplier entry meta with KSeF registration link"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Third-party companies (White Label)">
    Add a webhook after the **Register Party in KSeF** step to receive the `siloEntryId`.

    Use the [Fetch an Entry endpoint](/api-ref/silo/entries/fetch-an-entry) to get the registration link from the `meta` object:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "meta": [
          {
            "src": "gov-pl",
            "key": "link",
            "link_url": "https://ksef.invopop.com/reg/AbC123XyZ"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    Send the `link_url` to your customer.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="Generate Certificate in KSeF Portal">

The registration wizard will guide you through these steps:

1. **Open the correct KSeF portal**
   - Demo: [KSeF Demo Portal](https://ap-demo.ksef.mf.gov.pl/web/)
   - Production: [KSeF Portal](https://ap.ksef.mf.gov.pl/)

2. **Log in with Trusted Profile (Profil Zaufany)**
   - [Video tutorial: Setting up Trusted Profile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6E1fGUFPw4)

3. **Generate the certificate**
   - Navigate to certificate generation section
   - Enter certificate name and password (save the password!)
   - Download the private key (automatically generated)
   - Select "Authentication in the KSeF system"
   - Set start date to today or earlier (future dates will fail)
   - Download the certificate file
   - [Video tutorial: Certificate generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE0IHuPHtRE)

<Warning>
  Save these three items: **certificate file**, **private key file**, and **password**. You'll need all three in the next step.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Upload Certificate to Invopop">

You can upload the certificate in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Upload (Wizard)">
    Return to the registration wizard and upload:
    - Certificate file
    - Private key file
    - Password

    <Frame>
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/assets/guides/pl-upload-certificate.png"
        alt="KSeF certificate upload form"
      />
    </Frame>

    Click **Upload and verify certificate**. The system validates and securely stores your credentials.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API Upload">
    Upload the certificate programmatically using the [Upload KSeF certificate endpoint](/api-ref/apps/gov-pl/certificate-upload).

    <Note>
      This approach is ideal for automated integrations where you want to handle certificate generation and upload programmatically without user interaction with the web wizard.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

✓ **Success**: The supplier transitions to `Registered` state and can begin issuing invoices.

<Warning>
  **Upload failed?** Verify:
  - Certificate and private key match
  - Password is correct
  - Certificate start date is not in the future
  - Files are from the correct portal (demo vs production)
  - For API uploads: files are properly base64-encoded
</Warning>

</Step>

</Steps>

### Send an Invoice

Once a party is registered, you can issue invoices on their behalf. The following examples show partial [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) documents you can copy and paste directly into the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) or store via the API as silo entries.

<Tip>
  [GOBL Invoices](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) sent to KSeF require the following properties:
  - `$regime` set to [`PL`](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/pl)
  - `$addons` must include [`pl-favat-v3`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pl-favat-v3) for FA(3) schema compliance

After creating the invoice in the Console:
1. Click **Build** to validate
2. Click **Save** to store in the silo
3. Click **Select Workflow** and choose the **KSeF Send Invoice** workflow
4. Click **Run Workflow**

The invoice will be validated, converted to FA(3) XML format, and sent to KSeF. Upon successful clearance, it will receive a unique KSeF ID.

<Note>
  For international transactions, the invoice is created and cleared in KSeF just like domestic invoices. Because the foreign recipient cannot log into KSeF, delivery happens outside the platform (via email, EDI, etc.) with the KSeF QR code included for verification.
</Note>

### Import Received Invoices

Once you've configured the import and sync workflows, Invopop will automatically poll KSeF for new received invoices based on the polling interval you set during party registration.

#### How Automatic Import Works

1. **Polling Service**: Invopop checks KSeF at your configured interval (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month)
2. **Sync Workflow**: When new invoices are detected, the sync workflow queries KSeF for all invoices received since the last poll
3. **Import Jobs**: For each invoice found, a job is created using your import workflow
4. **Import Workflow**: Each job downloads the FA(3) XML from KSeF, converts it to GOBL format, and stores it in your Invopop silo
5. **Organization**: Imported invoices are automatically placed in the configured folder (typically "Invoices · Expenses") with a `Registered` state

<Note>
  **Polling Intervals**: You can set different polling intervals for each party during registration. If you don't want to automatically receive invoices for a specific party, set the polling interval to "no polling" during registration.
</Note>

#### Manual Import

If you need to import invoices outside of the automatic polling schedule, you can manually trigger imports using the Invopop API.

<Note>
  Manual import with workflow arguments is only available via API. The Console UI does not currently support passing custom arguments to workflow jobs.
</Note>

**Import a Single Invoice**

To import a specific invoice from KSeF:

1. **Get Invoice Details** from the KSeF portal:
   - **KSeF Number**: The unique invoice identifier (e.g., `1234567890-20260120-ABCD1234-EF`)
   - **Supplier NIP**: The Polish Tax ID of the invoice issuer

2. **Create a job via API** using the [Create a Job endpoint](/api-ref/silo/jobs/create-a-job):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.invopop.com/silo/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "YOUR_IMPORT_WORKFLOW_ID",
    "args": {
      "ksef-number": "1234567890-20260120-ABCD1234-EF",
      "nip": "1234567890"
    }
  }'
```

The invoice will be downloaded from KSeF, converted to GOBL, and stored in your silo.

**Import Multiple Invoices by Date Range**

To import all invoices received within a specific time period:

1. **Determine the date range** you want to sync (from and to dates)

2. **Create a job via API** using the [Create a Job endpoint](/api-ref/silo/jobs/create-a-job) with your sync workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.invopop.com/silo/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "YOUR_SYNC_WORKFLOW_ID",
    "entry_id": "YOUR_PARTY_ENTRY_ID",
    "args": {
      "from": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "to": "2026-01-31T23:59:59Z"
    }
  }'
```

The sync workflow will query KSeF for all invoices received in that date range and create individual import jobs for each invoice found.

<Tip>
  **Use Cases**:
  - **Single invoice**: Import a specific invoice immediately after receiving notification from a supplier
  - **Date range sync**: Backfill invoices after a polling outage or to import historical invoices before automatic polling was enabled
</Tip>

#### Error Handling and Notifications

We strongly recommend adding notification steps to your workflows to alert you of import failures:

- **In the Import Workflow**: Add email or Slack notifications to the error handling section
- **In the Sync Workflow**: Add notifications for when the sync process encounters issues

This ensures you're immediately aware if invoices fail to import, allowing you to take corrective action.

<Tip>
  **Common Import Issues**:
  - Certificate expired or invalid
  - KSeF API temporarily unavailable
  - Invoice format not supported by GOBL conversion
  - Network connectivity issues

  Check your workflow error logs in the Console for detailed error messages.
</Tip>
