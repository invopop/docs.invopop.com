## Introduction

To issue invoices in Argentina through ARCA, each supplier must generate a digital certificate from the ARCA website and upload it to Invopop. This guide walks you through the complete registration process.


## Setup

<Steps>
 <Step title="Connect the Argentina app">
    1. Go to **Configuration** → **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
    2. Find **Argentina** in the app list.
    3. Click **Connect** to activate the app.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a supplier registration workflow">
    Create a new workflow for registering suppliers. Start with the template below:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="ARCA supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=ar-supplier-registration" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.
        <ArRegistrationWorkflow />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "ARCA Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform the following steps:

        1. **Register supplier** - will generate a unique URL and add it into a `url` key value within the `meta` property. You could add a webhook or email step after this step to notify the supplier.
        2. **Set State** — select "Processing".
        3. **Wait for ARCA Authorization** - waits for the supplier to complete the registration process in the ARCA webpage.
        4. **Set State** — select "Registered".

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Register a supplier

The registration process is the same whether you're issuing invoices on behalf of third parties ([white label](/guides/use-cases/white-label)) or under your own company name.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a supplier entry">
      Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to create a new supplier [party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party). The required fields are:
      - `name` - company name
      - `tax_id` - tax identification number

      Set the `folder` parameter to `suppliers` so the entry appears in the suppliers section. The entry will have an `Empty` status initially.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the registration workflow">
    Trigger the supplier registration workflow using one of these methods:

    * **Via API** - Use the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint with the IDs of both the **silo entry** and **supplier registration workflow**.
    * **Via Console** - Open the supplier entry, click **Run workflow**, and select the **supplier registration workflow**.

    The supplier's status will change to `Processing` while awaiting registration completion.

   </Step>
   <Step title="Access the registration wizard">

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Your own company">
        In the Console, open the supplier entry and navigate to the **Meta** tab. Click on **gov-ar.invopop.com** to launch the registration wizard. 

        <Frame>
          <img
            width="398"
            src="/assets/console/entry-meta-argentina.png"
            alt="Supplier entry meta"
          />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Third-party companies">
        To send the registration link to your customer, add a webhook step before **Wait for ARCA Authorization**.

        The webhook payload includes the `siloEntryId`. Use the [Fetch an Entry endpoint](/api-ref/silo/entries/fetch-an-entry) to retrieve the full entry, including the `meta` object containing the registration link.

        Example `meta` object structure:

      <Accordion title="Example supplier meta registration link">
      ```
      data: {
        ...
        "meta": [
          {
            "id": "...",
            "created_at": "2025-11-05T15:10:28.132Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-11-14T15:56:53.727Z",
            "owner_id": "...",
            "entry_id": "...",
            "src": "gov-ar",
            "key": "link",
            "ref": "EgDeG3pDBDe",
            "link_url": "https://gov-ar.invopop.com/reg/EgDeG3pDBDe",
            "link_scope": "public",
            "indexed": true,
            "shared": true
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
      </Accordion>
        Send the `link_url` to your customer to complete their registration.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  </Steps>


## Complete the registration wizard

After opening the registration link, you'll be guided through a step-by-step wizard to create an ARCA certificate and upload it to Invopop.

The wizard steps differ between sandbox and production environments. For detailed instructions with screenshots:

- **Sandbox**: https://docs.invopop.com/sandbox/ar-arca-supplier
- **Production**: https://docs.invopop.com/ar-arca-supplier

Once you've successfully uploaded and validated the certificate, the supplier is ready to issue invoices.

## Point of sales (Punto de venta)

In Invopop, the point of sale is specified in the `series` field of the invoice.

**Sandbox environment**: You can use any point of sale number after obtaining your certificate.

**Production environment**: You must register each point of sale in ARCA before using it. The registration process varies depending on your tax classification:

- **Monotributista**: A simplified tax regime for small businesses and freelancers in Argentina
- **Registered taxpayer** (Responsable Inscripto): Standard tax regime for companies registered for VAT

Follow these steps to register a point of sale in production:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to point of sale administration">
    In ARCA, go to **Administración de puntos de venta y domicilios** (Point of Sale and Address Administration).

        alt="Administracion de puntos de venta y domicilios"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a new point of sale">
    Select **A/B/M de puntos de venta**, then click **Agregar nuevo punto de venta** (Add new point of sale). Choose the appropriate option for your tax classification:

    **For monotributista**: Select "Factura electronica - Monotributo - Web Service"
    <Frame>

        width="450px"
        alt="Monotributista point of sale"
      />
    </Frame>

    **For registered taxpayer**: Select "RECE para aplicativo y Web Service"
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/assets/guides/ar-company-pos.png"
        width="450px"
        alt="Registered taxpayer point of sale"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
