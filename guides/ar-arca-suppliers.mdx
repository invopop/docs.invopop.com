## Introduction

To issue invoices in Argentina through ARCA, each supplier must generate a digital certificate from the ARCA website and upload it to Invopop. This guide walks you through the complete registration process.


## Setup

<Steps>
 <Step title="Connect the Argentina app">
  <Frame>

      alt="Argentina App"
    />
  </Frame>
    1. Go to **Configuration** → **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
    2. Find **Argentina** in the app list.
    3. Click **Connect** to activate the app.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a supplier registration workflow">
    Create a new workflow for registering suppliers. Start with the template below:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="ARCA supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=ar-supplier-registration" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.
        <ArRegistrationWorkflow />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "Register in ARCA".

        The new workflow will need to perform the following steps:

        1. **Set State** — select "Processing".
        2. **Register supplier in ARCA** - will generate a unique URL and add it into a `url` key value within the `meta` property. Optionally, add a webhook or email step after this step to notify the supplier.
        3. **Wait for ARCA authorization** - waits for the supplier to complete the registration process in the ARCA webpage.
        4. **Set State** — select "Registered".

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Register a supplier

The registration process is the same whether you're issuing invoices on behalf of third parties ([white label](/guides/use-cases/white-label)) or under your own company name.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a supplier entry">

      <Badge color="green">Via API</Badge><br />
      Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to create a new supplier [party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party). The required fields are:
      - `name` - company name
      - `tax_id` - tax identification number

      Set the `folder` parameter to `suppliers` so the entry appears in the suppliers section. The entry will have an `Empty` status initially.

      <Badge color="green">Via Console</Badge><br />
      Navigate to **Parties > Suppliers** and click on <kbd>+ New supplier</kbd>. The following json code will appear in the editor:

      ```json
      {
        "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/org/party",
        "name": "", // Name of the company or individual
        "tax_id": {
            "code": "", // 11 digit CUIT
            "country": "" // "AR"
        }
      }
      ```
      Fill in the necessary information and click on <kbd>Build</kbd> and then <kbd>Save</kbd>.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the registration workflow">
    <Badge color="green">Via API</Badge><br />
    Use the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint with the following payload:

      ```json
      // POST https://api.invopop.com/transform/v1/jobs
      {
        "workflow_id": "<uuid>",
        "silo_entry_id": "<uuid>"
      }
      ```

      You can obtain the `workflow_id` from the workflows list, and the `silo_entry_id` from the **Meta** tab in the supplier entry.

    <Badge color="green">Via Console</Badge><br />
    Open the supplier entry, click <kbd>Run workflow</kbd>, and select **Register in ARCA**.

    The supplier's status will change to `Processing` while awaiting registration completion.

   </Step>
   <Step title="Access the registration wizard">

    <Badge color="blue">Your own company</Badge><br />
    In the Console, open the supplier entry and navigate to the **Meta** tab. Click on **gov-ar.invopop.com** to launch the registration wizard.

        width="398"

        alt="Supplier entry meta"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Badge color="blue">Third-party companies</Badge><br />
        To send the registration link to your customer, add a webhook step before **Wait for ARCA Authorization**.

        The webhook payload includes the `siloEntryId`. Use the [Fetch an Entry endpoint](/api-ref/silo/entries/fetch-an-entry) to retrieve the full entry, including the `meta` object containing the registration link.


            ``` json Example webhook response expandable
            data: {
              "meta": [
                {
                  "id": "...",
                  "created_at": "2025-11-05T15:10:28.132Z",
                  "updated_at": "2025-11-14T15:56:53.727Z",
                  "owner_id": "...",
                  "entry_id": "...",
                  "src": "gov-ar",
                  "key": "link",
                  "ref": "EgDeG3pDBDe",
                  "link_url": "https://gov-ar.invopop.com/reg/EgDeG3pDBDe",
                  "link_scope": "public",
                  "indexed": true,
                  "shared": true
                }
              ]
            }
            ```

        Send the `link_url` to your customer to complete their registration.
  </Step>
  </Steps>


## Complete the registration wizard

The wizard will guide the user to create a certificate in ARCA's portal and upload it to Invopop. The steps differ between sandbox and production. For your convenience, we provide guides in Spanish which you can share with your customers or adapt to your own needs:

- **Sandbox**: [ARCA certificate wizard (in Spanish)](/guides/ar-certificates-sandbox)
- **Production**: [ARCA certificate wizard (in Spanish)](/guides/ar-certificates-production)

Once you've successfully uploaded and validated the certificate, the supplier is ready to issue invoices.

## Point of sales (Punto de venta)

In Invopop, the point of sale is specified in the `series` field of the invoice. Once the registration process is complete, in **sandbox** you can use any point of sale number, while **production** requires registering each point of sale in ARCA before using it. The registration process varies depending on your tax classification:

- **Monotributista**: A simplified tax regime for small businesses and freelancers in Argentina
- **Registered taxpayer** (Responsable Inscripto): Standard tax regime for companies registered for VAT

Follow these steps to register a point of sale in production:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to point of sale administration">
    In ARCA, go to **Administración de puntos de venta y domicilios** (Point of Sale and Address Administration).

        alt="Administracion de puntos de venta y domicilios"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a new point of sale">
    Select **A/B/M de puntos de venta**, then click **Agregar nuevo punto de venta** (Add new point of sale). Choose the appropriate option for your tax classification:

    **For monotributista**: Select "Factura electronica - Monotributo - Web Service"

    </Frame>

    **For registered taxpayers**: Select "RECE para aplicativo y Web Service"
