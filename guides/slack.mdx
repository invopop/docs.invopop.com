Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. For instance, you might want to receive a message when one of your job executions fails: 

<Frame caption="Example workflow with Slack"><img src="/assets/guides/slack-workflow.png" /></Frame>

In this example, you will receive in your Slack channel `#random` a message like `Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!` when the PDF generation fails.

## Prerequisites

You require Slack account with full membership or an admin role within a workspace.

## How to use
