Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. For instance, you might want to receive a message when one of your job executions fails:

In this example, you will receive in your Slack channel "#random" a message like "Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!" when the PDF generation fails.

## How to use

For this explanation, we assume you already have a Slack Workspace created.

### 1. Configure the Slack App

To configure the Slack app in your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Apps section in the Invopop console.
2. Find the Slack App and click "Connect".
3. Click "Configure" and then "Add Slack Channel".
4. In the new opened window, select the channel where you want to send messages.

After you have selected a channel, you will be redirected back to the Invopop console, where you should see a message that says “Authorized and connected to:” followed by the list of channels that you are connected to. This confirms that the connection was successful.

In case you want to connect more channels, click the "Add Slack Channel" and connect the new one.
