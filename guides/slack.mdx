Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. For instance, you might want to receive a message when one of your job executions fails: 

<Frame caption="Example workflow with Slack"><img src="/apps/images/slack-workflow.png" /></Frame>

In this example, you will receive in your Slack channel `#random` a message like `Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!` when the PDF generation fails.

## Prerequisites

You require Slack account with full membership or an admin role within a workspace.

## How to use

For this explanation, we assume you already have a Slack Workspace created.

### 1. Configure the Slack App

To configure the Slack app in your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Configuration** â†’ **Apps**.
2. Find the **Slack** App and click `Connect`.
3. Click `Configure` and then `Add Slack Channel`.
4. In the newly opened window, select the channel where you want to send messages.

After you have selected a channel, you will be redirected back to the Invopop console, where you should see a message that says `Authorized and connected to:` followed by the list of channels that you are connected to. This confirms that the connection was successful.

In case you want to connect more channels, click the `Add Slack Channel` and connect the new one.
