## Introduction

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a powerful payments platform that enables businesses to accept online payments, manage subscriptions, and handle global financial operations.

This integration automatically processes Stripe invoices and credit notes through Invopop, converting them into the required local format and sending them to the appropriate tax authority.

The integration operates through two components: an app in the Invopop console and an Invopop app within Stripe that lets you manage your invoices directly from the Stripe dashboard.

## How it works

After installation and setup, whenever Stripe finalizes a new invoice or credit note, the system creates a new job in your selected workflow.

You can track your invoice status in Invopop directly from the Stripe dashboard. This interface also allows you to download invoice files and view details about the workflow processes.

## Setup

This guide assumes you already have a configured Stripe account.
<Steps>

<Step title="Install the Invopop app in Stripe">
Go to the [Invopop app listing in Stripe marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/invopop) and click the **Install** button. You can start with test mode and later switch to live mode when ready.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect the app to Invopop">
After installation, open the app in the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps/invopop) and click the **Connect Invopop** button to connect it to your Invopop account.

If you don't have an Invopop account, the connection process will guide you through creating one.

</Step>

<Step title="Select a workspace">
<Tip>
The app automatically skips this step if you only have one workspace.
</Tip>

After connecting, Stripe redirects you to select the Invopop workspace where you want to send invoices.

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Create a workflow">
Set up an Invopop workflow to process the Stripe invoices. Navigate to **Workflows** in the Invopop console and create a new **Invoices** workflow (or follow our [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows)).

Configure the workflow to convert and publish invoices according to your local regulations. You can add additional automation steps such as emailing invoices or storing them in cloud services.

Always add the **Import data from Stripe** step at the beginning of your workflow to import the document.
