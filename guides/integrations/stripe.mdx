## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to connect [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) with Invopop to automatically generate tax-compliant invoices and credit notes, from your Stripe dashboard.

The Stripe integration consists of two components:
1. An Invopop app within your Stripe dashboard
2. An app in your Invopop console

When a Stripe invoice or credit note reaches the [finalized status](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invoice-states), our integration will automatically create a new job in your selected Invopop workflow.

</Frame>

The job will extract the invoice data from Stripe and execute the actions, such as converting it to any e-invoice format and submitting it to your local tax authority.

## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have an active Stripe account.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Invopop in Stripe">
Navigate to the [Invopop app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/invopop) in Stripe's App Marketplace and click **Install**.
Next, Stripe will prompt you to select the Stripe environment you'd like to connect to, you can start with test mode or sandbox and switch to live later.

<Frame caption="Install Invopop in Stripe">
  ![stripe install](/guides/images/stripe-install.png)
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect Stripe to Invopop">
After installation, you should be  redirected to your Stripe dashboard and see the Invopop app in the right sidebar. Alternatively, just open the Invopop app in your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps/invopop).

Click **Connect Invopop**. The next page will ask you to login to your Invopop account. If you're new to Invopop, the connection process will guide you through creating your Invopop account and setting up your first workspace.

<Note>
When connecting a test or sandbox environment in Stripe, select a sandbox workspace in Invopop. For live environments, select a live workspace.

<Step title="Show your tax ID on invoices">
By default, Stripe does not display your tax ID on invoices. To enable it, go to Settings > Billing > Invoices. In the `Invoice Tax Information` section, enter your tax ID, set it as the default, and click **Save**.

## Monitor invoice processing

After setup, finalized Stripe invoices are imported into Invopop automatically and saved to the `Sales` folder. Use the steps below to verify status, review details, retry processing, and import historical invoices.

<Steps>

<Step title="Check invoice status in Stripe">
Open the invoice in Stripe and check the Invopop panel in the right sidebar to confirm whether processing succeeded.

<Frame caption="Invoice processed successfully in Stripe">
  ![stripe invoice status](/guides/images/stripe-invoice-success.png)
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Check invoice status in Invopop">
In the Invopop console, go to `Sales` and open the invoice to view its status. To review the underlying processing job, go to `Workflows` > `History` and open the job details.

<Frame caption="Job details in Invopop">
  ![stripe job details](/guides/images/stripe-invopop-job.png)
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Troubleshoot import errors">
If an invoice fails, it is usually one of two cases:

1. The invoice was not imported into Invopop because converting from Stripe to Invopop failed. Update the data in Stripe and click **Retry** in the Invopop panel. This often happens when attempting to import a draft invoice.

<Frame caption="Retry invoice">
  ![stripe retry invoice](/guides/images/stripe-retry-import.png)
</Frame>

2. The invoice was imported into Invopop but submission to the tax authority failed. Correct the invoice in Invopop and re-run a workflow that omits the **Import data from Stripe** step to avoid reimporting the original data. Typical causes include missing required fields or invalid field formats.

<Frame caption="Incorrect invoice details">
  ![stripe retry invoice](/guides/images/stripe-invoice-wrong-details.png)
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Get notified of failures">
Add a notification action in your workflow's Error Handling section—Slack, email, or webhook—so you're alerted when an import fails.

</Step>

</Steps>
