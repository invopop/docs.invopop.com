## Introduction
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a powerful payments platform that enables businesses to accept online payments, manage subscriptions, and handle global financial operations.

Invopop's Stripe app lets you issue locally compliant electronic invoices and credit notes from Stripe.

## How it works

The Invopop Stripe app will subscribe for new incoming invoices and credit notes. When a new document is received, it'll be _converted_ into GOBL, and stored in your Invopop workspace.

Once an invoice or credit note is stored, the app will create a job on the configured workflow.
