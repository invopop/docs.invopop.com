## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to connect [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) with Invopop to automatically generate tax-compliant invoices and credit notes, from your Stripe dashboard.

The Stripe integration consists of two components:
1. An Invopop app within your Stripe dashboard
2. An app in your Invopop console

When a Stripe invoice or credit note reaches the [finalized status](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invoice-states), our integration will automatically create a new job in your selected Invopop workflow.

The job will extract the invoice data from Stripe and execute the actions, such as converting it to any e-invoice format and submitting it to your local tax authority.
