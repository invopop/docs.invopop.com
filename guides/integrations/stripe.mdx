## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to connect [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) with Invopop to automatically generate tax-compliant invoices and credit notes, from your Stripe dashboard.

The Stripe integration consists of two components:
1. An Invopop app within your Stripe dashboard
2. An app in your Invopop console

When a Stripe invoice or credit note reaches the [finalized status](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invoice-states), our integration will automatically create a new job in your selected Invopop workflow.

The job will extract the invoice data from Stripe and execute the actions, such as converting it to any e-invoice format and submitting it to your local tax authority.

## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have an active Stripe account.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Invopop in Stripe">
Navigate to the [Invopop app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/invopop) in Stripe's App Marketplace and click **Install**.
Next, Stripe will prompt you to select the Stripe environment you'd like to connect to, you can start with test mode or sandbox and switch to live later.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect Stripe to Invopop">
After installation, you should be  redirected to your Stripe dashboard and see the Invopop app in the right sidebar. Alternatively, just open the Invopop app in your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps/invopop).

Click **Connect Invopop**. The next page will ask you to login to your Invopop account. If you're new to Invopop, the connection process will guide you through creating your Invopop account and setting up your first workspace.

<Note>
When connecting a test or sandbox environment in Stripe, select a sandbox workspace in Invopop. For live environments, select a live workspace.

## Import a Stripe invoice to Invopop

Once your setup is complete, finalized Stripe invoices are imported into Invopop **automatically**. Use the steps below to verify status, review details, retry processing, and import historical invoices when needed.

<Steps>

<Step title="Finalize the invoice in Stripe">
When an invoice reaches Stripe's "Finalized" status, Invopop automatically creates a job in your selected workflow and imports the invoice data.

<Frame caption="Invoice finalized in Stripe">

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Check processing status in Stripe">
Open the invoice in Stripe and view the Invopop app panel in the right sidebar to see whether processing succeeded.

<Frame caption="Processing status in Stripe">

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Review details in Invopop">
For a complete list and detailed logs, go to Invopop and open the job created for the invoice.

<Frame caption="Job details in Invopop">

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Retry or process an invoice manually">
If an invoice was not imported, open the invoice in Stripe and, in the Invopop app panel, click **Process this invoice** to trigger the import again. Use the same action to import older invoices issued before you connected Invopop.

<Frame caption="Manually process an invoice">

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Get notified about failures">
Add a notification action to your workflow's Error Handling section—such as a Slack step, email step, or webhook—so you're alerted if an import fails.
