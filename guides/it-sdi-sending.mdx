## Introduction

Electronic invoicing is mandatory for all businesses in Italy. The _Sistema di Interscambio_ (SDI) serves as the Italian government's central hub for transmitting, validating, and delivering all electronic invoices throughout the country.

The SDI system operates using a standardized XML format called FatturaPA, which ensures all invoices contain the required information and comply with the strict validation rules established by the Italian tax authority (_Agenzia delle Entrate_). To ensure proper routing of invoices to the correct recipient, the SDI system uses a unique identifier called a Recipient Code, which is assigned to each registered SDI provider.

Invopop simplifies SDI integration by allowing you to work with [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) format instead of XML, providing synchronous validation before submission, and offering a simple API integration with automatic handling of SDI notifications and status updates. For receiving invoices through SDI, see our companion guide: [Italy - SDI: Receiving Invoices](/guides/countries/it-sdi-receiving).

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the SDI Italy app">
1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**
2. Locate **SDI Italy** in the app discovery list
3. Tap **Connect** to activate

The initial connection requires no configuration for sending invoices.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure sending workflow">

<Info>
SDI does not have a sandbox environment. When `sandbox` mode is selected, Invopop's third-party submission service, [A-Cube](https://www.acubeapi.com), simulates a response from SDI.

    <SDISendWorkflow />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from scratch">

      Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

      In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) as the base. Then add the following steps:

        1. **Set State** - To `Processing`.
        2. **Sign Envelope** - Signs the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) document preventing further modifications.
        3. **Send to SDI (Italy)** - Generates the FatturaPA XML and sends it to SDI. Upon success, the XML file is attached to the invoice entry. If `sandbox` is chosen as the environment, the simulated response from SDI must be set.
        4. **Set State** - To `Sent`.

      In the **Error Handling** section, add a **Set State** step with the state set to `Error` to capture and flag failed imports.

      This is the minimal workflow with state handling required to automate the reception and visualization of invoices received through SDI. You may expand it with additional steps such as storing a backup copy, notifying clients, or integrating the documents into an ERP system.

## Sending Invoices

Invopop uses the [GOBL FatturaPA](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.fatturapa) library to process conversions. When creating invoices for SDI, you need to:

1. Set the `regime` field to `IT` in your GOBL invoice
2. Add the `it-sdi-v1` addon to enable Italian-specific validations and extensions

Detailed information about the SDI-specific extensions and validations can be found in:
- [Italy SDI FatturaPA v1.x Addon Documentation](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/it-sdi-v1)
- [Italy Tax Regime Documentation](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/it)

Example invoices are provided below, or you can use the [GOBL Builder](https://build.gobl.org) to create custom invoices.

### How the Send step works

This step generates the FatturaPA XML and sends it to SDI through our integration partner. Upon successful completion, the XML file is attached to the invoice entry. The SDI service usually responds within seconds but may take up to 24 hours. While waiting, this step remains in a `Queued` state.

When the Send step completes, it returns one of three results:
- `OK` if successful
- `KO` for unrecoverable errors
- `SKIP` if the invoice was already sent

## Technical Details

<Accordion title="SDI Response Codes and Statuses">
When the SDI step processes a document, it returns detailed status codes that provide information about the response from SDI:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rejected` | **Notifica di scarto (NS)** <br />SDI has rejected the invoice because it contains errors. |
| `delivered` | **Ricevuta consegna (RC)** <br />SDI has successfully delivered a B2B invoice to the recipient. |
| `delivered-pa` | **Ricevuta consegna (RC)**<br /> SDI has successfully delivered an invoice to a Public Administration (PA). |
| `not-delivered` | **Mancata consegna (MC)** <br />SDI could not deliver the invoice to the recipient. |
| `not-delivered` | **Attestazione trasmissione con impossibilità di recapito (AT)** <br />SDI couldn't deliver an invoice to PA after 10 days. |
| `accepted-pa` | **Notifica esito (NE)** <br />A PA has decided to accept an invoice (outcome EC01). |
| `rejected-pa` | **Notifica esito (NE)**<br /> A PA has decided to reject an invoice (outcome EC02). |
| `deadline-terms` | **Notifica decorrenza termini (DT)**<br /> A PA didn't reply with acceptance or rejection within 15 days. |
| `invoice-error` | An error occurred during the acquisition of a notification. |
| `sent` | The invoice has been submitted to SDI and is awaiting a response. |
| `not-received` | The invoice was not received by the recipient. |

Some SDI notifications (File metadati - MT, Esito committente - EC, Scarto esito committente - SE) don't directly change the code of the invoice.

These codes map to different step results as follows:

- **OK Result**: `delivered`, `not-delivered`, `not-received`, `accepted-pa`
- **KO Result**: `rejected`, `rejected-pa`, `invoice-error`, `deadline-terms`
- **QUEUED Result**: `sent`, `delivered-pa`

When a step returns `QUEUED`, the workflow will check again later for updates from SDI.
