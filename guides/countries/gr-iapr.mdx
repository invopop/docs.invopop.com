## Introduction

The myDATA (My Digital Accounting and Tax Application) platform is Greece’s standardized electronic invoicing and bookkeeping system, managed by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR). This system enables businesses to report invoices and accounting data in real time, ensuring compliance with Greek tax regulations.

This guide will walk you through the process of reporting invoices to the IAPR using myDATA, first registering a supplier, and then issuing invoices and credit notes in their name.

## Prerequisites

To issue invoices in Greece, you will need:

- Supplier details, including company name, TIN, and address.
- Customer details for B2B transactions, including name, TIN or international ID, and address.
- Line and item details, including quantity, price, description, applicable VAT rates, and, optionally, income classification codes.
- To have chosen an invoice series.

## Setup

There are two key processes to prepare:

- connect the ILYDA app,
- prepare an invoicing workflow.

The following steps must be done from the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com).

<Steps>

<Step title="Connect ILYDA Greece App">
Enter the **Configuration** section, then tap **Apps**. Tap on the **Connect** button of the **ILYDA Greece** app.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Tap the **Configure** button on the app, and choose the "Environment" you want to use.

Tap the **Save** button.

</Step>

<Step title= "Prepare Invoice Workflow">
Finally, we need to prepare the workflow for processing invoices. Go to the Workflows section and create a new "Invoice" workflow.

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="New Contacts Workflow"
    width="550px"
    src="/guides/images/gr-iapr-new-workflow.png"
  />
</Frame>

The workflow should be named something like "Issue IAPR Invoice", and it will consist of the following Steps:

- **Set State** - to "processing".
- **Add Sequential Code** - with dynamic sequences and a name like "IAPR Invoices".
- **Send to IAPR (via ILYDA)**.
- **Set State** - to "sent".

Tap the **Save** button to ensure the workflow has been persisted.

## Running

In this section, we'll provide details on how to register new suppliers and issue invoices on their behalf.

### Register a supplier

<Warning>
  Supplier registration is only possible in production. In the sandbox environment, your invoices must use a supplier with the tax ID code set to `177472438` which is the TIN of the test supplier pre-enabled in that environment.
</Warning>

Invopop has partnered with [ILYDA](https://ilyda.gr) to issue invoices in Greece. Each supplier must be registered with ILYDA to issue invoices on their behalf. This involves:

* Authorizing ILYDA as an electronic invoicing provider in Taxisnet.
* Declaring ILYDA as invoice issuer in myDATA.
* Signing a service provision agreement with ILYDA.

Please contact us via Slack or [support@invopop.com](mailto:support@invopop.com) whenever you need to onboard a new supplier. We will walk you through the process.

### Send an invoice

The following examples are of partial GOBL documents you can copy and paste directly into the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) or store via the API as silo entries. Then, you must run the "Issue IAPR Invoice" workflow created during setup.

As usual, the recommended approach for running jobs is to perform two steps; first, upload the document to the [silo](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put), second [create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put).

GOBL Invoices sent to myDATA require the following properties to perform the correct normalization and validation steps. Invopop will try to assign these automatically, but we recommend defining them explicitly before uploading:

- `$region` to be set to [`EL`](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/gr)
- `$addons` to include [`gr-mydata-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="B2B Invoice">

In this example, we're issuing a simple invoice from a Greek supplier to another Greek customer.

Notice:

- we've added the `gr-mydata-v1` addon; this ensures the document will be validated and normalized using the myDATA v1 rules built into the GOBL library,
- we've set the `services` tag; this makes the addon set the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension automatically to `2.1` (service invoice),
- similarly, the `cash` payment method will cause the addon to set the `gr-mydata-payment-means` extension to `3` (cash),
- other extensions (`ext`) have been explicitly set where values cannot be determined any other way,
- only VAT rates (`standard` and `exempt`) have been specified; percentages and values for the `gr-mydata-vat-rate` extension will be set automatically, and,
- there are no totals or calculations; all these will be made automatically when uploading.
