## Introduction

InvoiceNow is Singapore’s nationwide e‑invoicing platform. It is the local implementation of the international Peppol e‑invoicing network. Through InvoiceNow you can:
- Send and receive Peppol invoices in Singapore 
- Report invoices to IRAS

This guide covers:

1. How to register a supplier in InvoiceNow.
2. How to authorize our local partner (Storecove) to report invoices to IRAS on your behalf.
3. How to send and receive invoices via InvoiceNow in Invopop.

## Prerequisites

In order to register a supplier and issue invoices, you will need:

- Supplier details, including:
  - Legal Business name
  - Tax ID (UEN)
  - Business address
  - Peppol ID: `SGUEN` + your UEN (example: `SGUEN1234567890`).
- Corppass account: A [Corppass account](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/portal) is required for InvoiceNow registration.

## Setup

<Steps>
 <Step title="Connect the InvoiceNow Singapore app">
    1. Go to **Configuration** → **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
    2. Find **InvoiceNow Singapore** in the app list.
    3. Click **Connect** to activate the app.

    After connecting, you'll see InvoiceNow Singapore listed in the Enabled Apps section.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a supplier registration workflow">
    Create a new workflow in your workspace for registering suppliers for invoice sending, receiving and reporting to IRAS. You should start with the template below:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="InvoiceNow supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=sg-invoicenow-supplier-registration" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.

        <SupplierRegistration />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "InvoiceNow Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform the following steps:

        1. **Set State** — select "Processing".
        2. **Register in InvoiceNow** - Register the supplier in InvoiceNow.
        3. **Authorize IRAS Reporting** - Authorize Storecove to report invoices to IRAS on your behalf.
        4. **Set State** — select "Registered".

        Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.

## InvoiceNow registration

There are two registration paths depending on your needs:

1. Send/receive invoices only → Register your company in InvoiceNow.
2. Send/receive + IRAS reporting → Register in InvoiceNow and authorize Storecove for reporting.

### 1. Registering in InvoiceNow
First, create a supplier in Invopop with:

- Legal Business name
- Tax ID (UEN)
- Business address
- Peppol ID (key: `peppol`, scheme: `0195`, code: `SGUEN` + your UEN).

Here is a JSON example of a supplier:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/org/party",
    "uuid": "0199625b-5e4b-7000-8f52-d34327b98f92",
    "name": "Singapore Company",
    "tax_id": {
        "country": "SG",
        "code": "199912345A"
    },
    "inboxes": [
        {
            "key": "peppol",
            "scheme": "0195",
            "code": "SGUEN199912345A"
        }
    ],
    "addresses": [
        {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "locality": "Singapore",
            "code": "123456",
            "country": "SG"
        }
    ]
}
```

Next, run the `Register in InvoiceNow` step.
- This validates the supplier details and generates a Corppass URL.
- You have **25 minutes** to complete the Corppass flow.
- If the time expires, the step ends in `KO`, and you'll need to re-run it.

Once completed successfully (`OK`), the supplier is registered and can send/receive invoices via Peppol in Singapore.

### 2. Authorizing Invoice Reporting to IRAS
If you also need to report invoices to IRAS:
1. Run the `Authorize IRAS reporting` step.
    - This requires completing the `Register in InvoiceNow` step first.
    - Without InvoiceNow registration, you cannot report invoices to IRAS.
2. The process is similar to registration:
    - A Corppass URL is generated.
    - You have **25 minutes** to complete authorization.
    - If the time expires, the step ends in `KO`, and you'll need to re-run it.

Once successful (`OK`), Storecove will be authorized to report invoices to IRAS on your behalf.
