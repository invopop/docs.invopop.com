## Introduction

InvoiceNow is Singapore’s nationwide e‑invoicing platform. It is the local implementation of the international Peppol e‑invoicing network. Through InvoiceNow you can:
- Send and receive Peppol invoices in Singapore 
- Report invoices to IRAS

This guide covers:

1. How to register a supplier in InvoiceNow.
2. How to authorize our local partner (Storecove) to report invoices to IRAS on your behalf.
3. How to configure workflows for receiving invoices via InvoiceNow.
4. How to configure workflows for sending invoices via InvoiceNow.

## Prerequisites

In order to register a supplier and issue invoices, you will need:

- Supplier details, including:
  - Legal Business name
  - Tax ID (UEN)
  - Business address
  - Peppol ID: `SGUEN` + your UEN (example: `SGUEN1234567890`).
- Corppass account: A [Corppass account](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/portal) is required for InvoiceNow registration.

## Setup

<Steps>
 <Step title="Connect the InvoiceNow Singapore app">
    1. Go to **Configuration** → **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
    2. Find **InvoiceNow Singapore** in the app list.
    3. Click **Connect** to activate the app.

    After connecting, you'll see InvoiceNow Singapore listed in the Enabled Apps section.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a supplier registration workflow">
    Create a new workflow in your workspace for registering suppliers for invoice sending, receiving and reporting to IRAS. You should start with the template below:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="InvoiceNow supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=sg-invoicenow-supplier-registration" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.

        <SupplierRegistration />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "InvoiceNow Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform the following steps:

        1. **Set State** — select "Processing".
        2. **Register in InvoiceNow** - Register the supplier in InvoiceNow.
        3. **Authorize IRAS Reporting** - Authorize Storecove to report invoices to IRAS on your behalf.
        4. **Set State** — select "Registered".

        Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure invoice receiving workflow (optional)">
    If you need to receive invoices via InvoiceNow, create a workflow for processing incoming invoices. Choose the appropriate workflow based on whether you need to report received invoices to IRAS.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Receive only">
        Use this workflow if you only need to import invoices without reporting them to IRAS.

        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) code view.

        <ReceiveInvoice />

## Running

### Register a Supplier

There are two registration paths depending on your needs:

1. Send/receive invoices only → Register your company in InvoiceNow.
2. Send/receive + IRAS reporting → Register in InvoiceNow and authorize Storecove for reporting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register in InvoiceNow">
First, create a supplier in Invopop with:

- Legal Business name
- Tax ID (UEN)
- Business address
- Peppol ID (key: `peppol`, scheme: `0195`, code: `SGUEN` + your UEN).

Here is a JSON example of a supplier:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/org/party",
    "uuid": "0199625b-5e4b-7000-8f52-d34327b98f92",
    "name": "Singapore Company",
    "tax_id": {
        "country": "SG",
        "code": "199912345A"
    },
    "inboxes": [
        {
            "key": "peppol",
            "scheme": "0195",
            "code": "SGUEN199912345A"
        }
    ],
    "addresses": [
        {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "locality": "Singapore",
            "code": "123456",
            "country": "SG"
        }
    ]
}
```

Next, run the `Register in InvoiceNow` step.
- This validates the supplier details and generates a Corppass URL.
- You have **25 minutes** to complete the Corppass flow.
- If the time expires, the step ends in `KO`, and you'll need to re-run it.

Once completed successfully (`OK`), the supplier is registered and can send/receive invoices via Peppol in Singapore.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize IRAS reporting (optional)">
If you also need to report invoices to IRAS:
1. Run the `Authorize IRAS reporting` step.
    - This requires completing the `Register in InvoiceNow` step first.
    - Without InvoiceNow registration, you cannot report invoices to IRAS.
2. The process is similar to registration:
    - A Corppass URL is generated.
    - You have **25 minutes** to complete authorization.
    - If the time expires, the step ends in `KO`, and you'll need to re-run it.

Once successful (`OK`), Storecove will be authorized to report invoices to IRAS on your behalf.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Receive Invoices

Once you've configured a receiving workflow and connected it to the InvoiceNow app, incoming invoices will be automatically imported and processed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure automatic import">
    To enable automatic invoice import:

    1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
    2. Find **InvoiceNow Singapore** in the Enabled Apps section.
    3. Click **Configure**.
    4. Select your receiving workflow (created in the Setup section) from the dropdown.
    5. Click **Save**.

    All invoices received via InvoiceNow will now be automatically sent to this workflow for processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor incoming invoices">
    Received invoices will appear in your workspace's **Invoices** section with the status reflecting the workflow's processing:

    - If using the **Import only** workflow, invoices will be imported and stored in your workspace.
    - If using the **Import and Report** workflow, invoices will be imported and then reported to IRAS as purchase invoices.

    You can track the status of each invoice in the Console or via the API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Send Invoices

To send invoices via InvoiceNow, create GOBL invoice documents and send them to your invoice sending workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an invoice">
    Create a GOBL invoice with the necessary details:

    - Supplier information (must match a registered supplier)
    - Customer information including their Peppol ID
    - Line items with descriptions, quantities, and prices
    - Applicable tax rates

    Ensure the customer has a Peppol ID configured in their `inboxes` field with:
    - `key`: `peppol`
    - `scheme`: `0195` (for Singapore)
    - `code`: `SGUEN` + customer's UEN

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send to workflow">
    Send the invoice to your configured sending workflow:

    - If using the **Send only** workflow, the invoice will be transmitted via InvoiceNow.
    - If using the **Send and report** workflow, the invoice will be sent and simultaneously reported to IRAS.

    The invoice will be delivered to the customer's Peppol access point based on their Peppol ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track delivery status">
    Monitor the invoice status in the Console in the Silo Entry Meta:

    - **Sent**: Successfully delivered via InvoiceNow
    - **Reported**: Successfully reported to IRAS (if using send-and-report workflow)
    - **Error**: Check the workflow logs for detailed error information

    You can view delivery confirmations and any error messages in the invoice details.
  </Step>
</Steps>
