## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to issue invoices to French public institutions using Chorus Pro.

You will:

1. Learn about Chorus Pro and its format requirements
2. Set up Invopop workflows:
   a. Supplier registration workflow
   b. Invoice submission workflow
3. Prepare the Chorus Pro platform and create credentials
4. Register a supplier with Chorus Pro
5. Send your first invoice to a French public institution

### What is Chorus Pro?

Chorus Pro is a mandatory service provided by the French government for invoicing French public institutions. It allows businesses to upload invoices in multiple e-invoicing formats and track them throughout the French public administration process. All invoices to French public sector entities must be submitted through Chorus Pro.

The platform supports various e-invoicing formats including Cross Industry Invoice (CII), and implements the EN16931 European standard for electronic invoicing with additional French-specific requirements.

### Understanding Chorus Pro Format Requirements

Chorus Pro accepts invoices in CII (Cross Industry Invoice) format based on the EN16931 European standard. However, it adds specific French extensions and validation requirements:

**EN16931 Standard**
The European Norm 16931 defines the semantic data model for electronic invoices. It ensures interoperability across EU member states while allowing for country-specific extensions.

**Chorus Pro Extensions**
Chorus Pro extends the base EN16931 standard with additional French requirements:
- SIRET number validation for French entities
- Specific invoice types for different purposes
- Service codes for government departments

In GOBL, these formats are handled via addons which need to be added to each invoice. You'll see some examples of this further below.

## Setup
Now it's time to configure your Invopop Workspace for Chorus Pro invoicing.

You need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect the Chorus Pro app">
  1. Go to **Configuration** â†’ **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
  2. Find **Chorus Pro France** in the app list.
  3. Click **Connect** to activate the app.

  After connecting, you'll see Chorus Pro listed in the Enabled Apps section.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the supplier registration workflow">
    Add a new workflow to your workspace for registering suppliers. You can start with the template below.
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card iconType="duotone" title="Chorus Pro supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" href="" cta="Add to my workspace">
        This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow]() code view.
        <SupplierRegistration />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow]() as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "Chorus Pro Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform a single step:

        1. **Register for Chorus Pro** - Prepares the system so that provided supplier can send invoices.

        Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Keep the workflow ID at hand--you'll need it later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure invoice workflow">
    Add a new workflow to your workspace for issuing invoices. You can start with the template below.
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card iconType="duotone" title="Chorus Pro invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" href="" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will issue an invoice through Chorus Pro.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Invoice workflow]() code view.
        <WorkflowExample />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com) create a new workflow and select [Empty Invoice workflow]() in the template selector, then add the following steps:

        1. **Generate CII with EN16931 and Chorus Pro addons** - Creates the XML document with required extensions and adds it to the chain.
        2. **Send Chorus Pro (France)** - Submits the XML to Chorus Pro and returns the response.

        In the Error Handling section, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Keep the workflow ID at hand--you'll need it later.

    <Info>
      Chorus Pro allows for document modifications after submission. If a document is rejected or contains errors, update the GOBL details and resubmit to the same workflow until accepted.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running

Learn how to register a business entity and issue Chorus Pro invoices:

### Register a Supplier

Before sending invoices through Chorus Pro, you must register each supplier with their Chorus Pro account credentials. This allows Invopop to submit invoices on their behalf through the government platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Supplier">
  Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a new supplier. Include a [party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field. The following fields are required:

  - `name`
  - `tax_id`

    <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Example supplier">
      <Supplier />
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  After successful upload, you'll see the supplier in the **Contacts** section with status `Empty`.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-1.png" alt="Upload supplier to Invopop" />
  </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the Supplier to the registration workflow">
  Send the supplier to the registration workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:
  - The supplier's UUID from the previous step
  - The Supplier Registration workflow ID from the [Setup](#setup) section

  This workflow will guide the supplier through providing their Chorus Pro credentials securely.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-2.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Chorus Pro Authentication">
  The supplier will receive instructions to provide their Chorus Pro account credentials. This step is essential as Invopop needs access to their account to submit invoices on their behalf. See [Chorus Pro Setup Instructions](#chorus-pro-setup-instructions) for details on what needs to be configured within Chorus Pro.

  The supplier's status will change to `Registered` when authentication is complete.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-3.png" alt="Supplier registered successfully" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Suppliers must have an existing Chorus Pro account before registration. If they don't have one, they should create it at [chorus-pro.gouv.fr](https://chorus-pro.gouv.fr) before proceeding with the registration workflow.
</Warning>

### Send an Invoice

Once a supplier is registered, you can send invoices to French public institutions through Chorus Pro.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Invoice">
  Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to create a new invoice. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field.

  Key requirements for Chorus Pro invoices:
  - `supplier` must be a registered Chorus Pro supplier
  - `customer` must include the public institution identifier
  - `lines` with proper VAT configuration for B2G transactions

    <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Example B2G invoice">
      <B2GInvoice />
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-invoice-1.png" alt="Create invoice in Invopop" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send to Chorus Pro">
  Send the invoice to Chorus Pro using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:
  - The invoice UUID from the previous step
  - The Chorus Pro Invoice workflow ID from the [Setup](#setup) section

  The system will generate a CII XML file with Chorus Pro extensions and submit it to the platform.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-invoice-2.png" alt="Invoice sent to Chorus Pro" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Invoice Status">
  After submission, track your invoice in Chorus Pro using the invoice identifier (series + code). You can modify and resubmit invoices until they are accepted by the receiving institution.

  Once accepted, the invoice becomes locked and cannot be modified.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-invoice-3.png" alt="Track invoice in Chorus Pro portal" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The invoice identifier in Chorus Pro corresponds to your GOBL invoice series and code combined. This helps you locate and track invoices across both systems.
</Note>
