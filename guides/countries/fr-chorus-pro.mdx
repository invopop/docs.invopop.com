## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to issue invoices to French public institutions using [Chorus Pro](https://portail.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/).

You will:

1. Learn about Chorus Pro and its format requirements
2. Set up Invopop workflows:
   - Supplier registration workflow
   - Invoice submission workflow
3. Prepare the Chorus Pro platform and create credentials
4. Register a supplier with Chorus Pro
5. Send your first invoice to a French public institution

### What is Chorus Pro?

Chorus Pro is a mandatory service provided by the French government for invoicing French public institutions. It allows businesses to upload invoices in multiple e-invoicing formats and track them throughout the French public administration process. All invoices to French public sector entities must be submitted through Chorus Pro.

The platform supports various e-invoicing formats including [Cross Industry Invoice (CII)](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/e-invoice), and implements the [European Norm 16931 (EN16931)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/European+Standard+and+Specifications) European standard for electronic invoicing with additional French-specific requirements.

### Understanding Chorus Pro Format Requirements

Chorus Pro accepts invoices in CII format based on the EN16931 European standard. However, it adds specific French extensions and validation requirements:

**EN16931 Standard**
The EN16931 defines the semantic data model for electronic invoices. It ensures interoperability across EU member states while allowing for country-specific extensions.

**Chorus Pro Extensions**
Chorus Pro extends the base EN16931 standard with additional French requirements:
- SIRET number validation for French entities
- Specific invoice types for different purposes
- Service codes for government departments

In GOBL, these formats are handled via addons which need to be added to each invoice. You'll see some examples of this further below.

## Setup
Now it's time to configure your Invopop Workspace for Chorus Pro invoicing.

You need to:

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the required apps">
1. Go to **Configuration** > **Apps** in the *Console*.
2. Find **UN/CEFACT CII** in the app list and click **Connect** to activate it.
3. Find **Chorus Pro** in the app list and click **Connect** to activate it.

After connecting, you'll see both UN/CEFACT CII and Chorus Pro listed in the Enabled Apps section.

<Step title="Configure the supplier registration workflow">
    Add a new workflow to your workspace for registering suppliers. You can start with the template below.
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card iconType="duotone" title="Chorus Pro supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=chorus-pro-registration" cta="Add to my workspace">
        This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.
        <SupplierRegistration />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow]() as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "Chorus Pro Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform a single step:

        1. **Register a supplier for Chorus Pro** - Prepares the system so that provided supplier can send invoices.

        Add any additional steps you may need such as error handling, and save the new workflow.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Keep the workflow ID at hand as you'll need it later.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure invoice workflow">
    Add a new workflow to your workspace for issuing invoices. You can start with the template below.
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card iconType="duotone" title="Chorus Pro invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=chorus-pro-invoice" cta="Add to my workspace">

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com) create a new workflow and select [Empty Invoice workflow]() in the template selector, then add the following steps:

        1. **Generate UN/CEFACT CII Invoice** - You need to select _Chorus Pro V1_ as the `Invoice Output Document Type`.
        2. **Send Chorus Pro**.

        In the Error Handling section, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Keep the workflow ID at hand as you'll need it later.

    <Info>
      Chorus Pro allows for document modifications after submission. If a document is rejected or contains errors, update the GOBL details and resubmit to the same workflow until accepted.

## Running

Now you'll learn how to register a supplier and issue Chorus Pro invoices:

### Register a Supplier

Now that you have a technical account, you can register a supplier with Chorus Pro.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Supplier">
    Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a new supplier. Include a [party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field. For this step we only need the VAT number.

    After successful upload, you'll see the supplier in the **Contacts** section with status `Empty`.
    <Frame>
      <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-1.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the Supplier to the registration workflow">
    Send the supplier to the registration workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:
    - The supplier's UUID from the previous step
    - The Supplier Registration workflow ID from the [Setup](#setup) section

    This workflow will generate a unique URL for the supplier to access and complete the registration process. This URL will be stored in the supplier's metadata.

    <Frame>
      <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-2.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Chorus Pro Authentication">
    The workflow will stay in progress until the supplier completes the registration process. The supplier must access the link and add the credentials they have previously created.

    <Frame>
      <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-3.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
    </Frame>

    The supplier's status will change to `Registered` when authentication is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Send an Invoice

Once a supplier is registered, you can send invoices to French public institutions through Chorus Pro.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Invoice">
  Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to create a new invoice. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field.

    <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Example B2G invoice">
      <B2GInvoice />
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  Take a look at the example above. Notice how you need both the `eu-en16931-v2017` and the `fr-choruspro-v1` addon. These will enable all the necessary validations in your GOBL invoice.

  <Step title="Send to Chorus Pro">
  Send the invoice to Chorus Pro using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:
  - The invoice UUID from the previous step
  - The Chorus Pro Invoice workflow ID from the [Setup](#setup) section

  The system will generate a CII XML file with Chorus Pro extensions and submit it to the platform.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-xml.png" alt="Invoice sent to Chorus Pro" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Invoice Status">
  After submission, track your invoice in [Chorus Pro](https://cpro.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/cpp/rechercheFacturesEmises) using the invoice identifier (series + code). You can modify and resubmit invoices until they are accepted by the receiving institution.

  Once accepted, the invoice should not be modified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The invoice identifier in Chorus Pro corresponds to your GOBL invoice series and code combined. This helps you locate and track invoices across both systems.
