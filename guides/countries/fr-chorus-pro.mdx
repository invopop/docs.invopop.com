## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to issue invoices to French public institutions using [Chorus Pro](https://portail.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/).

You'll:

1. Learn about Chorus Pro and its format requirements
2. Set up Invopop workflows:
   - Supplier registration workflow
   - Invoice submission workflow
3. Prepare the Chorus Pro platform and create credentials
4. Register a supplier with Chorus Pro
5. Send your first invoice to a French public institution

### What is Chorus Pro?

Chorus Pro is a mandatory service provided by the French government for invoicing French public institutions. The platform allows businesses to upload invoices in multiple e-invoicing formats and track them throughout the French public administration process. All invoices to French public sector entities must be submitted through Chorus Pro.

The platform supports various e-invoicing formats including [Cross Industry Invoice (CII)](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/e-invoice), and implements the [European Norm 16931 (EN16931)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/European+Standard+and+Specifications) European standard for electronic invoicing with additional French-specific requirements.

### Understanding Chorus Pro Format Requirements

Chorus Pro accepts invoices in CII format based on the EN16931 European standard. However, it adds specific French extensions and validation requirements:

**EN16931 Standard**
The EN16931 defines the semantic data model for electronic invoices. The standard ensures interoperability across European Union (EU) member states while allowing for country-specific extensions.

**Chorus Pro Extensions**
Chorus Pro extends the base EN16931 standard with additional French requirements:
- SIRET number validation for French entities
- Specific invoice types for different purposes
- Service codes for government departments

In GOBL, these formats are handled via addons that you must add to each invoice. You'll see examples of this further below.

## Setup
Configure your Invopop Workspace for Chorus Pro invoicing.

Complete these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the required apps">
1. Go to **Configuration** > **Apps** in the Console.
2. Find **UN/CEFACT CII** in the app list and click **Connect** to activate the app.
3. Find **Chorus Pro** in the app list and click **Connect** to activate the app.

After connecting, you'll see both UN/CEFACT CII and Chorus Pro listed in the Enabled Apps section.

## Running

Now you'll learn how to register a supplier and issue Chorus Pro invoices:

### Register a Supplier

Now that you have a technical account, register a supplier with Chorus Pro.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Supplier">
    Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a new supplier. Include a [party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field. For this step, you only need the VAT number.

    After successful upload, you'll see the supplier in the **Contacts** section with status `Empty`.
    <Frame>
      <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-1.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the Supplier to the registration workflow">
    Send the supplier to the registration workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:
    - The supplier's UUID from the previous step
    - The Supplier Registration workflow ID from the [Setup](#setup) section

    This workflow generates a unique URL for the supplier to access and complete the registration process. The URL is stored in the supplier's metadata.

    <Frame>
      <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-2.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Chorus Pro Authentication">
    The workflow stays in progress until the supplier completes the registration process. The supplier must access the link and add the credentials they created previously.

    <Frame>
      <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-supplier-3.png" alt="Supplier registration in progress" />
    </Frame>

    The supplier's status will change to `Registered` when authentication is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Send an Invoice

Once a supplier is registered, you can send invoices to French public institutions through Chorus Pro.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Invoice">
  Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to create a new invoice. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field.

    <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Example B2G invoice">
      <B2GInvoice />
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  Review the example above. Notice that you need both the `eu-en16931-v2017` and the `fr-choruspro-v1` addon. These addons enable all the necessary validations in your GOBL invoice.

  <Step title="Send to Chorus Pro">
  Send the invoice to Chorus Pro using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:
  - The invoice UUID from the previous step
  - The Chorus Pro Invoice workflow ID from the [Setup](#setup) section

  The system generates a CII XML file with Chorus Pro extensions and submits it to the platform.

  <Frame>
  <img width="450" src="/guides/images/fr-chorus-pro-xml.png" alt="Invoice sent to Chorus Pro" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Invoice Status">
  After submission, track your invoice in [Chorus Pro](https://cpro.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/cpp/rechercheFacturesEmises) using the invoice identifier (series plus code).

    <Info>
      Chorus Pro allows document modifications after submission. If a document is rejected or contains errors, update the GOBL details and resubmit to the same workflow until the document is accepted.
      Once accepted, do not modify the invoice.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The invoice identifier in Chorus Pro corresponds to your GOBL invoice series and code combined. This identifier helps you locate and track invoices across both systems.
