## Introduction

Invopop's SDI Italy provider allows you to generate and issue FatturaPA documents in Italy.

## Prerequisites

To issue invoices, you need:

- Supplier details:
  - Company name and address
  - Italian tax ID (Partita IVA)
- For B2B sales, customer details including:
  - Italian tax ID (Partita IVA)
- Invoice line items with
  - Price
  - VAT rates

## Setup

Follow these steps to configure your Invopop Workspace for SDI invoicing:

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the SDI Italy app">

1. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Apps**.
2. Locate **SDI Italy** in the app discovery list.
3. Click **Connect** to activate.

No additional configuration is needed.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure invoice workflow">

First, review our [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the basics.

Create an **Invoices** workflow with these essential steps:

1. **Sign Envelope** - Signs the GOBL document. Can be substituted with `Add Sequential Code` with the `Sign Document` option enabled.
2. **Send to SDI (Italy)** - Generates the required FatturaPA document and submits it to SDI. If `sandbox` is chosen as the environment, the simulated response from SDI has to be set.

<Info>
SDI does not have a sandbox environment. When `sandbox` mode is selected, Invopop's third party submission service, [A-Cube](https://www.acubeapi.com), simulates a response from SDI.

You can copy and paste the following JSON while editing a Workflow in "developer" mode. This example adds support for setting states on silo entries and handling errors, both of which we strongly recomend.

## Running

Invopop uses the [GOBL](https://gobl.org) library to process conversions, in particular the [GOBL FatturaPA](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.fatturapa) library. Some example invoices are provided below, along with an example workflow to send the invoices to. We also recommend using the [GOBL Builder](https://build.gobl.org) to create your own invoices.

Be sure to set the `regime` field to `IT` in your invoices and add the `it-sdi-v1` addon. This will add some extra validations and normalizations to ensure the document is compliant, and automatically add the necessary extensions, which can be found [here](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/tree/main/regimes/it#italy-specific-requirements).

The SDI service usually responds within seconds but may take up to 24 hours. While waiting, the **Send to SDI** step remains `Queued`.

When finished, this step returns:

- `OK` if successful
- `KO` for unrecoverable errors
- `SKIP` if the invoice was already sent

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is electronic invoicing mandatory in Italy?">

Yes, electronic invoicing through SDI is mandatory in Italy for B2G, B2B and B2C transactions.

All invoices must be issued in FatturaPA format and transmitted through the SDI (Sistema di Interscambio) platform.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I correct an invoice?">

There are two main ways to correct an invoice in the Italian SDI system:

1. Issue a credit note (Nota di Credito - TD04) to fully or partially cancel the original invoice.
2. Issue a debit note (Nota di Debito - TD05) to integrate/correct the original invoice with additional charges.

The corrective document must reference the original invoice number and date.
