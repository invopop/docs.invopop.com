# France - PDP (Plateforme de Dématérialisation Partenaire)

France handles e-invoicing through approved PDP (_Plateforme de Dématérialisation Partenaire_) platforms as part of its electronic invoicing reform. Invopop is an officially approved PDP platform, as listed on the [French government's official list of approved platforms](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/liste-des-plateformes-agreees-immatriculees-sous-reserve).

## Official Approval Status

Invopop is _immatriculée sous réserve_ (registered under reserve) by the French tax administration, meaning we have successfully passed the first stage of the approval process and provided all necessary documentation for the registration procedure.

The approval process consists of two stages:

1. **Registration under reserve** - ✅ **Completed** - Invopop has provided all required documentation and passed the initial approval stage
2. **Technical compliance verification** - Scheduled for end of 2025 - This will verify technical compliance with specifications including platform-to-platform invoice exchange and data extraction capabilities

**Important:** No PDP platform can be fully certified yet, as the technical compliance verification stage will not begin until late 2025.

## PDP and Peppol Network

The French PDP system relies on the [Peppol network](/guides/features/peppol) infrastructure with additional French-specific requirements. This creates a "five corner model" for e-invoicing compliance:

1. **Supplier** - Issues the invoice
2. **Supplier's PDP** - Processes and transmits the invoice
3. **DGFiP (French Tax Administration)** - Receives mandatory invoice data and status updates
4. **Customer's PDP** - Receives and processes the invoice
5. **Customer** - Receives the final invoice

## What This Means for You

As an approved PDP platform, Invopop will:

- **Issue** electronic invoices through the Peppol network with French compliance
- **Transmit** invoices to other PDP platforms via Peppol infrastructure
- **Send mandatory data** to DGFiP for each invoice as required by French law
- **Report status updates** to DGFiP throughout the invoice life cycle
- **Handle annuaire (French e-invoicing directory) registration** for French e-invoicing directory compliance  
- **Receive** electronic invoices from other approved platforms
- **Extract** necessary data for tax administration purposes

## Getting Started

French e-invoicing via PDP platforms will become mandatory starting **September 2026**. While Invopop is already approved as a PDP platform, the service is not yet available as we continue developing and preparing for the mandatory implementation date.

We will update this guide with detailed setup instructions and configuration details as we approach the launch date. In the meantime, you can familiarize yourself with our [Peppol guide](/guides/features/peppol), as the French PDP system builds upon the Peppol network infrastructure.
