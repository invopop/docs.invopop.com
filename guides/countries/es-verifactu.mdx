## Introduction

VERI\*FACTU is a fiscal initiative by the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) that requires businesses to report invoices through certified software. The system generates unique identifiers for each invoice and creates digitally signed XML files that are submitted to the tax authorities.

## Prerequisites

To register a supplier and issue invoices, you need:

- Supplier details:
  - Company name
  - Spanish tax ID (NIF)
- For B2B sales, customer details including:
  - Tax ID (for Spanish/EU entities)
- Invoice line items with
  - Price
  - VAT rates

## Setup

Follow these steps to configure your Invopop Workspace for VERI\*FACTU invoicing:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect the VERI*FACTU app">
  1. Navigate to **Configuration** â†’ **Apps**.
  2. Locate **VERI\*FACTU** in the app discovery list.
  3. Click **Connect** to activate.

  No additional configuration is needed.

        This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.
        <SupplierRegistration />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "VERI*\FACTU Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform a single step:

        1. **Register for VERI*\FACTU** - Prepares the system so that provided supplier can send invoices.

        Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com) create a new workflow and select [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) in the template selector, then add the following steps:

          1. **Sign Envelope** - Signs the VERI\*FACTU document. Can be substituted with `Add Sequential Code` with the `Sign Document` option enabled.
          2. **Generate VERI\*FACTU (Spain)** - Creates the required XML document, adding it to the chain and fingerprinting it. It can be seen in the `Files` section of the console.
          3. **Send VERI\*FACTU (Spain)** - Submits the generated XML to AEAT gateway and returns a response.
          4. **Generate PDF** - Generates the PDF invoice with the required QR code.

          Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select "Error" in the State dropdown.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Info>
      VERI\*FACTU allows for document modifications after submission. If a document is rejected or contains invalid information, make the modifications to the GOBL details and send again to the same workflow.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running

Invopop uses the [GOBL](https://gobl.org) library to process conversions. Some example invoices are provided below, along with an example workflow to send the invoices to. We also recommend using the [GOBL Builder](https://build.gobl.org) to create your own invoices.

Be sure to set the `regime` field to `ES` in your invoices and add the `es-verifactu-v1` addon. This will add some extra validations and normalizations to ensure the document is compliant, and automatically add the necessary extensions, details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.verifactu/?tab=readme-ov-file#tax-extensions).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is VERI*FACTU compliance mandatory in Spain?">

VERI\*FACTU is currently scheduled to be mandatory for businesses in Spain from July 1st, 2025. However, it is likely that the deadline will be extended to January 1st, 2026 for companies and to July 1st, 2026 for self-employed individuals. Refer to [the proposal](https://www.hacienda.gob.es/SGT/NormativaDoctrina/Proyectos/04112024-Verifactu-Consulta-Publica-Previa.pdf) for more details.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I correct an invoice?">

There are three ways to correct an invoice:

1. The recommended approach is to issue a GOBL Invoice with the type `credit-note` or `debit-note`, which in VERI\*FACTU translates to a "Factura Rectificativa por Diferencias".
2. If the above approach does not apply, you can issue an invoice of type `corrective`, which in VERI\*FACTU translates to a "Factura Rectificativa por SustituciÃ³n".
3. Lastly, you can use the `Cancel VERI\*FACTU (Spain)` step, which will void the invoice in the tax authority. This should only be used under special circumstances and not as part of a regular workflow.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What should I do if an invoice is rejected by VERI*FACTU?">

The response from VERI*FACTU should contain all the details you need to be able to decide what changes need to be made to the GOBL document in order to be processed correctly. Make the changes either via the Invopop API or console **directly on the same document**, and simply resend to the VERI*\FACTU workflow.

Invopop will ensure that the correct substition document is generated by checking previous attempts and including the correct codes in the new request.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the VERI*FACTU chain?">

VERI\*FACTU requires every request to be linked with a fingerprint or hash. During the "Generate VERI\*FACTU" and "Cancel VERI\*FACTU" actions, Invopop will automatically find the last request made for the same supplier, and incorporate the chained data into the new reuqest.

Its important to understand the VERI\*FACTU focusses on requests, and not individual documents; a single invoice may have multiple entries in the chain if it has been processed multiple times due to incorrect details, cancellations, or substitutions.

Invopop guarantees the chain is never broken using database transactions and retries in the case of collisions.
