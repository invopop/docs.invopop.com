## Introduction

<Warning>The Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) is still finalizing VERI\*FACTUâ€™s technical and legal requirements. Invopopâ€™s implementation may change accordingly.</Warning>

VERI\*FACTU is is a fiscal initiative by the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) that requires businesses to report invoices through certified software. The system generates unique identifiers for each invoice and creates digitally signed XML files that are submitted to the tax authorities. 

<Note>VERI\*FACTU will be mandatory for companies from January 1st, 2026. The rest of tax payers from 1 July 2026. Companies reporting with SII or TicketBAI are exempt from reporting with VERI\*FACTU</Note>

## Prerequisites

To register a supplier and issue invoices, you need:

- Supplier details:
  - Company name
  - Spanish tax ID (NIF)
  - Supplier agreement signature
- For B2B sales, customer details including:
  - Tax ID (for Spanish/EU entities)
- Invoice line items with:
  - Price
  - VAT rates

## Setup

Configure your Invopop Workspace for VERI\*FACTU invoicing by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect the VERI*FACTU app">
    1. Go to **Configuration** â†’ **Apps** in the [Console](https://console.invopop.com).
    2. Find **VERI\*FACTU Spain** in the app list.
    3. Click **Connect** to activate the app.

    <Frame caption="Connect the VERI*FACTU app">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/guides/images/es-verifactu-app.png"
        alt="VERI*FACTU app connected"
      />
    </Frame>

    After connecting, you'll see VERI\*FACTU listed in the Enabled Apps section.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Supplier Registration Workflow">
    Add a new workflow to your workspace for registering suppliers. You should start with the template below:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="VERI*FACTU supplier registration workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=es-verifactu-supplier-registration" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will issue a registration request for a supplier to complete.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.

        <SupplierRegistration />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "VERI\*FACTU Supplier Registration".

        The new workflow will need to perform the following steps:

        1. **Register for VERI\*FACTU (Spain)** - Sends an email to the supplier with a registration link.
        2. **Set State** â€” select "Processing".
        3. **Wait for Registration VERI\*FACTU (Spain)** - Configure the wait time (in days) for the supplier to complete the registration form, sign agreements and attach the required documentation.
        4. **Wait for Validation VERI\*FACTU (Spain)** - Invopop will validate the provided supplier documentation in less than 72 hours. If rejected it will generate an error and block the supplier from issuing invoices. 
        5. **Set State** â€” select "Registered"

        Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Keep the `Workflow ID` at hand, you'll use it later.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Keep the `Workflow ID` at hand, you'll use it later.

    <Info>
      VERI\*FACTU allows for document modifications after submission. If a document is rejected or contains errors, update the GOBL details and resubmit to the same workflow.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How VERI\*FACTU supplier registration works

Invopop has a collaboration agreement with the Spanish tax agency ([AEAT](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es)) allowing us to issue invoices on behalf of any entity using our certificate. This eliminates the need for you to request the entity's certificate.

The process is best explained looking at the workflow steps:

    <Frame caption="Supplier Registration Workflow">
      <img
        width="385"
        src="/guides/images/es-verifactu-register-supplier.png"
        alt="Supplier Registration Workflow"
      />
    </Frame>

    1. **Register with VERI\*FACTU** will generate a unique URL and add it into a `url` key value within the `meta` property. You would add a webhook after this step to notify the supplier.
    2. **Set State to Processing** labels the silo entry so you know it's in process of registration.  
    3. **Wait for Supplier Registration VERI\*FACTU** waits for the supplier to upload the required documents (signed agreement and ID).
    4. **Set State to Registered** labels the silo entry so you know registration is complete.
    5. **Wait for Approval VERI\*FACTU** Invopop will review the documents provided by the supplier. If there are any problems the workflow will error with a `KO` and the reason for rejection can be reviewed in the Supplier's job history. The supplier's issuing entitlement will be revoked immediately.
    

### Register a Supplier

Suppliers need to provide the following documents for Invopop to issue invoices on their behalf:

1. A signed and stamped [direct representation agreement](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/static_files/Sede/Procedimiento_ayuda/ZC01/Mod/Anexo_I_mod_otorg_prof_trib.pdf). If the supplier is a self-employed individual (_autÃ³nomo_), stamping is unnecessary.
2. A copy of signatory's fiscal ID (DNI/NIE).

These documents will be collected through a multi-step web form (_wizard_) which is sent to the supplier (or your company) through the _Supplier Registration Workflow_ we created during setup. 

    <Frame caption="Supplier Registration Wizard">
      <img
        width="640"
        src="/guides/images/es-verifactu-supplier-registration-portal.png"
        alt="Supplier Registration Wizard"
      />
    </Frame>

Whether you issue invoices on behalf of third parties ([white label](/guides/use-cases/white-label)) or under your own name, the process is essentially the same. However, we divide the use case here for clarity:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upload and register third-parties">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Upload a Supplier">
      Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a new supplier. Include a [party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) (you can copy the example below) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field. The following fields are required:

      - `name`
      - `tax_id`
      - `address`
      - `email`

      <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Example supplier">
          <Supplier />
        </Accordion>
      </AccordionGroup>

    After a successful upload, you'll see the supplier in the **Contacts** section with status `Empty`.

    <Frame caption="Upload supplier to Invopop">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/guides/images/es-verifactu-supplier-2.png"
        alt="Upload supplier to Invopop"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Supplier to the registration workflow">

    **With the API**

    Send the supplier to the registration workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - The `Silo Entry ID` of the supplier you uploaded on the previous step
    - The Supplier Registration `Workflow ID` from the [Setup](##setup) section

    **Through the Console**

    Locate the recently created supplier in the **Contacts** section and tap on "Select Workflow". From the side panel, select the **VERI\*FACTU supplier registration workflow** you created in the [Setup](##setup) section.

    ***

    The supplier will receive an email with the registration link, and the supplier's status will change to `Processing` while waiting for supplier registration and verification. Once these steps are completed successfully, the supplier's status will change to `Registered`. If not successful because the supplier did not complete the process or their documentation was rejected, the status will change to `Error`, and you can inspect the job history of this document to see the reason.

        <Frame caption="Supplier registered successfully">
          <img

    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Upload and register your company">
    <Steps>
    <Step title="Create your company in the Supplier section">

      We will set up your company as a supplier within Invopop so that we can register it for issuing VERI\*FACTU invoices. First, click on **Contacts** on the left sidebar and click on the **New Contact** button at the top right corner of the screen:

      We suggest that you copy and modify our example supplier to your own information, then you can paste it into the editor in **Code View**. Then switch to **Form view** as indicated in the screenshot, this will build and validate the silo entry and, if there are no errors, you'll be able to save your company's information as a Silo Entry. 

      <Supplier />

    After saving, you'll see your company in the **Contacts** section with status `Empty`.

    <Frame caption="Create Supplier in Invopop">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send your company to the registration workflow">

    Locate your company in the **Contacts** section and tap on "Select Workflow". From the side panel, select the **VERI\*FACTU supplier registration workflow** you created in the [Setup](##setup) section.

    An email will be sent to the address stated in the email field, and the status will change to `Processing` while waiting for you to upload the required documents. As soon as registration is complete, it will be possible to issue VERI\*FACTU invoices. However, in the rare case we detect a problem with the documentation provided, we will revoke it until the correct documentation is provided.

    After your documentation is reviewed the status will change to `Registered`. Otherwise the status will change to `Error`, and you can inspect the job history of this document to see the reason.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Invoice to the VERI*FACTU invoice workflow">
    Send the invoice to the VERI\*FACTU workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: use the Workflow ID of the _VERI\*FACTU invoice: workflow we created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: use the The Silo Entry ID of the invoice you've just uploaded.

    The invoice's status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.

    <Frame caption="Sent invoice">

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Issue a Credit Note (Rectificativa por Diferencias)

In Spain, one way to correct an invoice is by issuing a credit note, known as a _Rectificativa por Diferencias_.
An alternative method is to issue a _Rectificativa por SustituciÃ³n_, which involves creating a new invoice with the type corrective.

The difference between the two is subtle but important:

- A credit note adjusts the value of the original invoice.
- A corrective invoice replaces the original invoice entirely.

For example, if you issued an invoice for â‚¬100 but later realized it should have been â‚¬80, you can either:

- Issue a credit note for â‚¬20, or
- Issue a corrective invoice for â‚¬80.

Unless you have a specific requirement to use a corrective invoice we recommend only using credit notes. They're more widely supported across countries, while corrective invoices are specific to a few jurisdictions like Spain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Credit Note">
    A credit note in Invopop is an invoice of the type credit note. So the process is very similar to uploading an invoice. Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a credit note. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data), with these required fields:

    - `regime`: `ES`
    - Add the `es-verifactu-v1` addon
    - `supplier`: use the same supplier details as in the original invoice
    - `type`: `credit-note`
    - `preceding`: references the original invoice, within it, you must include:
      - `uuid`: the UUID of the original invoice (optional but recommended)
      - `type`: type of the original invoice
      - `issue_date`: the date of the original invoice
      - `series`: the series of the original invoice
      - `code`: the code of the original invoice

    You can copy one of the example credit notes below as a reference.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Credit Note">
        <CreditNote />
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    After successful upload, you'll see the credit note in the **Invoices** section with status `Empty`. If you've included the `uuid` of the invoice in preceding, you'll see a link to the credit note we've just created in the _Related_ tab of the invoice.

    <Frame caption="Link to the credit note">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/guides/images/es-verifactu-invoice-cn.png"
        alt="Invoice related to a credit note"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Credit Note to the VERI*FACTU invoice workflow">
    Send the credit note to the VERI\*FACTU workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: use the Workflow ID of the _VERI\*FACTU invoice _workflow we created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: use the The Silo Entry ID of the credit note you've just uploaded.

    The credit note's status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Issue a Corrective Invoice (Rectificativa por SustituciÃ³n)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Corrective Invoice">
    A corrective invoice in Invopop is an invoice of the type `corrective`. So the process is very similar to uploading an invoice. Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a corrective invoice. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data), with these required fields:

    - `regime`: `ES`
    - Add the `es-verifactu-v1` addon
    - `supplier_id`: use the same supplier details as in the original invoice
    - `type`: `corrective`
    - `preceding`: references the original invoice, within it, you must include:
      - `uuid`: the UUID of the original invoice (optional but recommended)
      - `type`: type of the original invoice
      - `issue_date`: the date of the original invoice
      - `series`: the series of the original invoice
      - `code`: the code of the original invoice
      - `tax`: the tax section of the original invoice, you can copy it from the original invoice

    You can copy one of the example corrective invoices below as a reference.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Corrective Invoice">
        <CorrectiveInvoice />
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    After successful upload, you'll see the corrective invoice in the **Invoices** section with status `Empty`. If you've included the `uuid` of the invoice in preceding, you'll see a link to the corrective invoice we've just created in the _Related_ tab of the invoice.

    <Frame caption="Link to the corrective invoice">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/guides/images/es-verifactu-invoice-corrective.png"
        alt="Invoice related to a corrective invoice"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Corrective Invoice to the VERI*FACTU invoice workflow">
    Send the corrective invoice to the VERI\*FACTU workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: use the Workflow ID of the _VERI\*FACTU invoice_ workflow we created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: use the The Silo Entry ID of the corrective invoice you've just uploaded.

    The corrective invoice's status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Cancel an Invoice

VERI\*FACTU also allows you to cancel an invoice. In general, you should only cancel an invoice if it hasn't been handed to the customer nor accepted by the tax authority.

Different from a credit note or a corrective, canceling an invoice doesn't produce a second document, which means you don't have a paper to hand to your customer to show the cancellation. That's why, if the invoice has been handed to the customer, we recommend issuing a credit note instead.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a cancel invoice workflow (only once)">
    To cancel an invoice, you need a workflow with the _Cancel VERI\*FACTU (Spain)_ step. You can start with the template below.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="VERI*FACTU cancel invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=es-verifactu-cancel" cta="Add to my workspace">

        <CancelInvoice />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "VERI\*FACTU Cancel Invoice".

        We recommend adding the following steps:

        1. **Cancel VERI\*FACTU (Spain)** - Cancels the VERI\*FACTU document.
        2. **Set State** - select _Void_ in the step configuration. This will set the state of the invoice to `Void`.
        3. In the Error Handling area, **Set State** - select `Error` in the step configuration.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to cancellation workflow">
    To cancel an invoice, simply send it to the VERI\*FACTU cancel invoice workflow we just created using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint.

    The invoice's status will change to `Void` when the workflow completes successfully.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is VERI*FACTU compliance mandatory in Spain?">
    VERI\*FACTU is currently scheduled to be mandatory for businesses in Spain from July 1st, 2025. However, it is likely that the deadline will be extended to January 1st, 2026 for companies and to July 1st, 2026 for self-employed individuals. Refer to [the proposal](https://www.hacienda.gob.es/SGT/NormativaDoctrina/Proyectos/04112024-Verifactu-Consulta-Publica-Previa.pdf) for more details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I correct an invoice?">
    There are three ways to correct an invoice:

    1. The recommended approach is to issue a GOBL Invoice with the type `credit-note` or `debit-note`, which in VERI\*FACTU translates to a "Factura Rectificativa por Diferencias".
    2. If the above approach does not apply, you can issue an invoice of type `corrective`, which in VERI\*FACTU translates to a "Factura Rectificativa por SustituciÃ³n".
    3. Lastly, you can use the `Cancel VERI\*FACTU (Spain)` step, which will void the invoice in the tax authority. This should only be used under special circumstances and not as part of a regular workflow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I do if an invoice is rejected by VERI*FACTU?">
    The response from VERI**_FACTU should contain all the details you need to be able to decide what changes need to be made to the GOBL document in order to be processed correctly. Make the changes either via the Invopop API or console directly on the same document, and simply resend to the VERI\*FACTU workflow.

    Invopop will ensure that the correct substitution document is generated by checking previous attempts and including the correct codes in the new request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the VERI*FACTU chain?">
    VERI\*FACTU requires every request to be linked with a fingerprint or hash. During the "Generate VERI\*FACTU" and "Cancel VERI\*FACTU" actions, Invopop will automatically find the last request made for the same supplier, and incorporate the chained data into the new request.

    Its important to understand the VERI\*FACTU focuses on requests, and not individual documents; a single invoice may have multiple entries in the chain if it has been processed multiple times due to incorrect details, cancellations, or substitutions.

    Invopop guarantees the chain is never broken using database transactions and retries in the case of collisions.

  <Accordion title="What happens if a supplier does not complete their registration within the allotted wait time?">
    A KO will be triggered and the supplier will be labelled with the `Error` state. We currently recommend sending a reminder to the supplier through a webhook.

    The registration link will not expire and the entity will still be able to upload their registration documents which will be validated. Should you choose to run this workflow again using this supplier, the supplier will be accepted or rejected immediately because the required documentation has already been provided and validated.

  <Accordion title="What happens if a supplier validation is rejected?">
    A KO will be triggered and the supplier will be labelled with the `Error` state. We currently recommend sending a  notification to the supplier through a webhook.

    The supplier can then replace the document(s) which were rejected during the approval process.
