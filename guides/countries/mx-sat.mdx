## Introduction

The CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet) is the standardized electronic invoicing format in Mexico, managed by the country’s tax authority, the SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria). This system ensures that all fiscal documents are digitally generated, validated, and reported to SAT in compliance with national tax laws.

In this guide we'll walk you through the steps required to first register a supplier and then issue invoices in their name.

## Prerequisites

To issue invoices in Mexico via the SAT, you will need:

- Supplier details, including:
  - name,
  - taxpayer ID or RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes),
  - address, and,
  - fiscal regime code issued by SAT.
- Customer details, the same as the supplier, plus _CFDI use code_ (código de uso CFDI).
- Line item details including quantities, prices, applicable tax rates, and the SAT _product-service code_.
- To have chosen an invoice series.
- Issue place code (lugar de expedición).
- A _signing certificate_ known as a CSD (Certificado de Sello Digital) issued by the SAT for every supplier.

## Setup

There are four key processes to prepare:

- create supplier post-registration workflow,
- connect the SAT Mexico app,
- configure a supplier registration workflow, and,
- prepare an invoicing workflow.

<Info>
  These instructions apply to both the sandbox and live environments, with a few
  exceptions for supplier data and registration details when real details are
  not available.
</Info>

All of the following steps must be carried out from the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com).

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Supplier post-registration workflow (optional)">
Head over to the **Workflows** section and create a new "Contacts" workflow.

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="New Contacts Workflow"
    width="350px"
    src="/guides/images/mx-sat-new-workflow.png"
  />
</Frame>

Rename the workflow to "Post-registration flow", and add a single step to change the state to `registered`.

At this point you can add any webhooks or notification steps that might be useful for your systems to receive after a supplier has successfully registered.

Tap the **Save** button.

<Accordion title="Supplier post-registration workflow example">
Copy and paste the following example in the workflow editor:
<PostRegistration />
</Accordion>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect the SAT Mexico App">
Enter the **Configuration** section, then tap **Apps**. Tap on the **Connect** button of the **SAT Mexico** app.
<Frame>
<img src="/guides/images/mx-sat-app.png" width="360px" alt="SAT MX App" />
</Frame>

Tap the **Configure** button on the App, and choose the "Post-registration flow" workflow we created in the previous step, or leave empty.

Tap the **Save** button.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the supplier registration workflow">
Back in the **Workflows** section, create a new "Contacts" workflow called "Register Supplier".

The new workflow will need to perform three steps:

- **Sign the Envelope**
- **Register SAT Issuer**
- **Set State** - with configuration set to `processing`.

Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.

<Accordion title="Supplier registration workflow example">
Copy and paste the following example in the workflow editor:
<RegisterSupplier />
</Accordion>

</Step>

<Step title="Prepare Invoice Workflow">
Finally, we need to prepare the actual workflow that will be used to process invoices. For this example the workflow should be named something like "Issue SAT Invoices", and it will consist of the following Steps:

- **Add Sequential Code** - with dynamic sequences, and name like "SAT Invoices".
- **Send to SAT (Mexico)**.
- **Generate PDF** - configured for your environment.
- **Set State** - to "sent".

Tap the **Save** button to ensure the workflow has been persisted.

</Steps>

## Running

In this section we'll provide details on how to first persist and register a supplier, followed by issuing invoices on their behalf.

As usual, the recommended approach for running jobs is to perform two steps; first upload the document to the [silo](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put), second [create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put).

### Register a Supplier

Suppliers can be registered either manually via the Invopop Console or programatically via the API. The process is essentially the same, so for this guide we'll demonstrate the manual process.

<Warning>
  Suppliers in Mexico must authorize the PAC (Procesador Autorizado de
  Certificación) used by Invopop to sign, stamp and send CFDIs to the SAT on
  their behalf. Please visit https://firmamanifiesto.lunasoft.net/ and follow
  the process to authorize [SW Sapiens by Luna Soft S.A. de
  C.V.](https://sw.com.mx/). This is not an automated service and can only be
  performed manually by a representative of the supplier.
</Warning>

Find the **Contacts** section of the sidebar and click **Suppliers**. Tap the **+ New Supplier** button to be presented with a new editor. Copy and paste the following example that uses example data provided by the SAT. This will only work in sandbox environments, in production you'll need the details of a real company:

<Supplier />

Tap **Build**, ensure there are no errors, and click **Save**.

We should now see the document. Find and click the **Select Workflow** button. Select the **Register Supplier** workflow created during setup, and click **Run Workflow**.

The execution should be successful, and the silo entry will now be in the "Processing" state. Tap the **Meta** tab to see the registration link:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/guides/images/mx-sat-reg-link.png"
    width="450px"
    alt="Supplier Registration Link"
  />
</Frame>

<Info>
  You can access the registration link via the API by [fetching the silo
  entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/fetch-an-entry) and reading the `meta` row where
  the `key` is set to `registration-link`.
</Info>

Tap the registration link and a new browser window will be presented with a form to upload the credentials for the supplier. Note that this form can be shared directly with the supplier if required.

<Frame>
  <img src="/guides/images/mx-sat-reg-csd.png" alt="Issuer Registration Form" />
</Frame>

The details from this form are sent securely to the PAC (Authorised Certification Provider) who will be responsible for signing invoices and sending them to the SAT. You can find test RFCs and CSDs on the [SW Sapien test pages](https://developers.sw.com.mx/knowledge-base/donde-encuentro-csd-de-pruebas-vigentes/). Download the zip file and extract the certificates if you'd like to try out the full flow.

The CSD comprises two files (with extensions `.cer` and `.key`) and a password. Suppliers, companies or individuals, can follow [this guide on how to obtain one](https://sw.com.mx/blog/administracion-fiscal/sellos-digitales-que-son-y-como-funcionan).

Certificates have already been registered for all sandbox users, so you can safely run the "Post-registration flow" workflow manually and leave the new supplier in the `sent` state.

From this point on you can now send invoices on behalf of the supplier.

### Send an Invoice

The following examples are of partial GOBL documents you can copy and paste directly into the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) or store via the API as silo entries.

GOBL Invoices sent to the SAT require the following properties in order to perform the correct normalization and validation steps. Invopop will try to assign these automatically, but we recommend defining them explicitly before upload:

- `$region` to be set to [`MX`](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/mx)
- `$addons` to include [`mx-cfdi-v4`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/mx-cfdi-v4)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="B2B Invoice">

In this example we're issuing a simple B2B invoice from a Mexican supplier to another Mexican customer.

Notice:

- we've added the `mx-cfdi-v4` addon, this ensures the document will be validated using the CFDI v4 rules built into the GOBL library,
- extensions (`ext`) fields have been used in multiple locations for fields whose values cannot be determined any other way,
- VAT will be applied at the standard rate, the percentage will be set automatically, and,
- there are no totals nor calculations, all of these will be made automatically when uploading.

<Accordion title="Which PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación) does Invopop use?">
  Invopop uses [SW Sapien](https://sw.com.mx), an Authorised Certification
  Provider (PAC), to sign and stamp CFDI documents for the Mexican tax
  authority.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find the mapping of GOBL fields to CFDI?">
The library that transforms GOBL into CFDI documents is publicly available as an open-source project and can be found at [github.com/invopop/gobl.cfdi](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.cfdi).

For further details on how GOBL prepares data for conversion, see the [Mexico Tax Regime](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/mx/README.md).
