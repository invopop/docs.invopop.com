## What is our Wizard?

The Wizard is a portal that allows your customers pass the necessary legal requirements as painlessly as possible.

For invopop to start issuing e-invoices for VERI\*FACTU on behalf of your customer, each user needs to submit a signed document called an "agreeement of representation". This legal step is mandatory for compliance with the Agencia Tributaria.

In this simple guide, we will explain the onboarding process for your customers. In the Wizard portal, customers will input data, upload files and send a generated document to Invopop. All in one place.

Some clients opt to embed the portal into an iframe on their own platform. You can find the link to the portal [here](https://verifactu.invopop.com/reg/KI2tOR1HN3T/start)



## Step 1 - How to use the Wizard

After clicking the link, your customers will be met with the first page detailing the necessary documentation required for the process.

For authentication, the customer must upload a copy of their NIE/NIF or passport. Identification documents are not needed if the customer uses an e-signature with a valid certificate. This way is recommended.


### Checklist to begin

- Company NIF (Spanish tax ID) and registered address
- legal representative's ID (DNI/NIE/passport) and address
- Clear images of the front and back for ID photos




## Step 2 - Input your data

On the following page, the legal representative of the business fills in basic details such as the company name, NIF and address. Located just below are fields relating to the legal representative, such as their address and ID number.

 Or if manually signed:
- A signature that matches the one on the passport or identity card.
- The date of signature.  




## Step 4 - Upload the signed agreement form
