# What is our Wizard?

The Wizard is a portal that allows your customers to pass the necessary legal requirements as painlessly as possible.  

For invopop to start issuing e-invoices for VERI*FACTU on behalf of your customer, each user needs to submit a signed document called an "agreeement of representation". This legal step is mandatory for compliance with the Agencia Tributaria.  

In this simple guide, we will explain the onboarding process for your customers. In the Wizard portal, customers will input data, upload files and send a generated document to Invopop. All in one place.  

Some clients opt to embed the portal into an iframe on their own platform. You can find the link to the portal [here](https://verifactu.invopop.com/reg/KI2tOR1HN3T/start)

# How to use the Wizard

After clicking the link, your customers will be met with the first page detailing the necessary documentation required for the process.  

For authentication, the customer must upload a copy of their NIE/NIF or passport. Identification documents are not needed if the customer uses an e-signature with a valid certificate. This way is recommended.  

# Checklist to begin

+ Company NIF (Spanish tax ID) and registered address. 
+ legal representative's ID (DNI/NIE/passport) and address. 
+ For ID photos -- clear images of the front and back. 

# Input your data

On the following page, the legal representative of the business fills in basic company details such as the name, NIF and address. Located just below are fields relating to the legal representative, such as their address and ID number.   

Once completed, users click continue and move on to the next page.

# Download the agreement form

On the following page, the customer can download and sign their agreement. The details from the previous page will auto-populate into the contract.  

To sign, the user needs:
+ A valid e-signature with date and tax number.
Or if manually signed:
+ A signature that matches the one on the passport or identity card. 
+ The date of signature.

# Upload the signed agreement form

The agreement can now be uploaded on this page. Customers select the type of signature they used and upload their document.

# Upload your ID

If the user signed with an e-signature, uploading an ID photo is not required. For the rest, they upload a copy of their chosen ID as a JPG or PDF. Both the front and reverse of the copy is submitted here.  

# Review your details

This is the final step. This page provides a summary of information so the user can verify they have submitted the correct data. Any corrections can be easily adjusted through the edit function.  

The customer simply clicks confirm, and awaits approval from our team.  

# Error Handling

We can't approve documents when there are mistakes, here are the most common:

+ The uploaded document is not signed (they upload the template by mistake)
+ Users upload a manual signature without ID
+ The electronic signature is not approved by a recognized authority
+ The agreement is missing a date or location
+ The name is entered as an email address

Users are notified with a reason for their rejection, making corrections easy.
