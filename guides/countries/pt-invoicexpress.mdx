## Introduction

Invopop partners with the local invoicing provider [InvoiceXpress](https://invoicexpress.com/) to issue invoices, invoice-receipts, and credit notes in Portugal and allow users to submit their tax reports (SAF-T) to the Portuguese tax authority (AT).

This guide explains how to integrate with [InvoiceXpress](https://invoicexpress.com/), a Portuguese invoicing provider that enables you to:
* Issue compliant invoices, invoice-receipts, and credit notes in Portugal
* Submit tax reports (SAF-T) to the Portuguese tax authority (AT)
* Enable real-time tax reporting

For technical details and examples of Portuguese GOBL documents, see the [GOBL Portugal Tax Regime documentation](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/pt/README.md).

## Prerequisites
To issue invoices through InvoiceXpress, you'll need the following information:

* Supplier Details, including:
  * Legal business name
  * Tax ID (NÃºmero de IdentificaÃ§Ã£o Fiscal)
  * Complete business address
  * Contact email address

* Invoice details, including:
  * Line item descriptions
  * Quantities and unit prices
  * Applicable Portuguese VAT rates

## Setup

The integration requires three main components:

1. InvoiceXpress app connection
2. Supplier registration workflow
3. Invoice processing workflow

All of the following steps must be carried out from the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com).
<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect InvoiceXpress App">
    1. Navigate to the **Configuration** section
    2. Select **Apps**
    3. Locate **InvoiceXpress Portugal**
    4. Click **Connect**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Supplier Registration Workflow">
    Create a workflow to register your suppliers with InvoiceXpress:

    1. Go to the **Workflows** section
    2. Create a new "Contacts" workflow
    3. Name it "Register supplier in InvoiceXpress"
    4. Add the following required steps:
       * **Sign the Envelope** - Validates the document
       * **Register InvoiceXpress issuer** - Creates supplier account
       * **Set State** - Marks progress as `processing`

    For quick setup, use our pre-configured workflow below:

    <Accordion title="Supplier Registration Workflow example">
      <RegisterSupplier/>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Invoice Processing Workflow">
    Create a workflow for processing invoices with these essential steps:

    1. Name the workflow "Send invoice to InvoiceXpress"
    2. Add these required steps:
       * **Send to InvoiceXpress** - Transmits invoice data
       * **Generate PDF** - Creates document (configure for your environment)
       * **Set State** - Updates status to "sent"

    For quick setup, use our pre-configured workflow below:

    <Accordion title="Invoice Processing Workflow example">
      <IssueInvoice/>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running

### Sandbox Environment

InvoiceXpress provides a way to configure their accounts to use the AT's sandbox environment so that you can test the issuance of invoices and credit notes end-to-end without fiscal or legal consequences. If you wish to use this environment, please contact us via Slack or support@invopop.com and we will walk you through the setup process.

### Supplier Onboarding

InvoiceXpress supports multiple suppliers under one integration. Each supplier receives their own account for document issuance and tax reporting.

Follow these steps to onboard a supplier:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit Supplier Information">
    Send a [GOBL Party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) document to your supplier registration workflow. The system will automatically:

    * Create an InvoiceXpress account
    * Send login credentials to the supplier's email (first email in the `emails` list)

    Example GOBL Party document:

    <Accordion title="Example supplier" defaultOpen={false}>
      <ExampleSupplier/>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure InvoiceXpress account">
    The user invited to the new account will now have to log in to InvoiceXpress and complete the account's configuration.

    An account will be ready to issue invoices once a default sequence is registered in the AT. This guide from InvoiceXpress' documentation explains how to do it:
    - [Sequence Registration Guide (English)](https://invoicexpress.helpscoutdocs.com/article/219-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-and-registering-series)
    - [Guia de Registro de SÃ©ries (Portuguese)](https://invoicexpress.helpscoutdocs.com/article/212-atcud-guia-passo-a-passo-para-criar-e-registar-series)

    **Important Notes:**
    * You'll find a pre-created sequence in the account pending to be registered. You can register and use that one, or create a different one, as you prefer.
    * In any case, you must ensure the sequence you want to use is the default one in the account. Currently, only the default series can be used to issue documents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Send an invoice
Once configured, you can begin issuing documents:

1. Create [GOBL Invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) documents following [PT regime specifications](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/pt/README.md)
2. Send to your invoice processing workflow
3. Ensure the `supplier` UUID and Tax ID match the registered supplier details

### Additional Features

Suppliers can:
- Export SAF-T reports through InvoiceXpress UI
- Configure real-time tax reporting using this guide: [Portal das FinanÃ§as Integration Guide](https://invoicexpress.helpscoutdocs.com/article/92-como-crio-um-sub-utilizador-no-portal-das-financas)
