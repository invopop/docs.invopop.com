## Introduction

VERI\*FACTU is a fiscal initiative by the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) that requires businesses to report invoices through certified software. The system generates unique identifiers for each invoice and creates digitally signed XML files that are submitted to the tax authorities.

<Note>VERI\*FACTU will be mandatory for companies from January 1st, 2027. The rest of tax payers from 1 July 2027. Companies reporting with SII or TicketBAI are exempt from reporting with VERI\*FACTU.</Note>

## Prerequisites

To issue your first VERI\*FACTU invoice, you must have had registered at least one supplier. Make sure you read and implemented the [VERI*FACTU supplier registration guide](/guides/countries/es-verifactu-supplier) before continuing with this guide.


## Setup

Add a new workflow to your workspace for issuing invoices. You can start with the template below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Template">
    <Card title="VERI*FACTU invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=es-verifactu-invoice" cta="Add to my workspace">
      This workflow will issue an invoice through VERI\*FACTU.
    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code">
    Copy and paste into a new [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) code view.

    <WorkflowExample />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from scratch">
    In [Console](https://console.invopop.com) create a new workflow and select [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) in the template selector, then add the following steps:

    1. **Sign Envelope** - Signs the VERI\*FACTU document.
    2. **Generate XML** - Creates the XML document and adds it to the chain. View it in the `Files` section.
    3. **Issue invoice** - Submits the XML to AEAT and returns the response.
    4. **Generate PDF** - Creates the PDF invoice with the required QR code.

    In the Error Handling section, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Keep the `Workflow ID` at hand, you'll use it later.

<Info>
  VERI\*FACTU allows for document modifications after submission. If a document is rejected or contains errors, update the GOBL details and resubmit to the same workflow.

## Issue an Invoice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload an Invoice">
    Use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload the invoice details. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data) field with these required fields:

    - `regime`: `ES`
    - Add the [`es-verifactu-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/es-verifactu-v1) addon
    - `supplier`: Use the details of the supplier you've registered before.

    You can copy one of the example invoices below as a reference.

    <ExamplesAccordion />

    After uploading you'll see the document in the **Invoices** section with status `Empty`.

    <Frame caption="Empty invoice">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/assets/guides/es-verifactu-invoice-1.png"
        alt="Empty invoice"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Invoice to the VERI*FACTU invoice workflow">
    Send the invoice to the VERI\*FACTU workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: use the Workflow ID of the _VERI\*FACTU invoice_ workflow we created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: use the Silo Entry ID of the invoice you've just uploaded.

    The invoice's status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.

    <Frame caption="Sent invoice">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/assets/guides/es-verifactu-invoice-2.png"
        alt="Sent invoice"
      />
    </Frame>

    You can verify that the PDF was generated by clicking on the invoice and selecting the PDF from the "Files" tab.

    </Frame>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Issue a Credit Note (Rectificativa por Diferencias)

In Spain, one way to correct an invoice is by issuing a credit note, known as a _Rectificativa por Diferencias_.
An alternative method is to issue a _Rectificativa por Sustitución_, which involves creating a new invoice with the type corrective.

The difference between the two is subtle but important:

- A credit note adjusts the value of the original invoice.
- A corrective invoice replaces the original invoice entirely.

For example, if you issued an invoice for €100 but later realized it should have been €80, you can either:

- Issue a credit note for €20, or
- Issue a corrective invoice for €80.

Unless you have a specific requirement to use a corrective invoice we recommend only using credit notes. They're more widely supported across countries, while corrective invoices are specific to a few jurisdictions like Spain. Examples where you would need to issue a corrective invoice (_Rectificativa por Sustitución_) are incorrect supplier or client data, which can't be corrected through credit or debit notes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Credit Note">
    A credit note in Invopop is an invoice of the type credit note. The process is very similar to uploading an invoice, use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a credit note. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data), with these required fields:

    - `regime`: `ES`
    - Add the [`es-verifactu-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/es-verifactu-v1) addon
    - `supplier`: use the same supplier details as in the original invoice
    - `type`: `credit-note`
    - `preceding`: references the original invoice, within it, you must include:
      - `uuid`: the UUID of the original invoice (optional but recommended)
      - `type`: type of the original invoice
      - `issue_date`: the date of the original invoice
      - `series`: the series of the original invoice
      - `code`: the code of the original invoice

  You can copy the example credit note below as a reference.

	<CreditNote />

  After successful upload, you'll see the credit note in the **Invoices** section with status `Empty`. If you've included the `uuid` of the invoice in preceding, you'll see a link to the credit note we've just created in the _Related_ tab of the invoice.

    <Frame caption="Link to the credit note">
      <img
        width="100%"
        src="/assets/guides/es-verifactu-invoice-cn.png"
        alt="Invoice related to a credit note"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Credit Note to the VERI*FACTU invoice workflow">
    Send the credit note to the VERI\*FACTU workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: use the Workflow ID of the _VERI\*FACTU invoice _workflow we created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: use the The Silo Entry ID of the credit note you've just uploaded.

    The credit note's status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Issue a Corrective Invoice (Rectificativa por Sustitución)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Corrective Invoice">
    A corrective invoice in Invopop is an invoice of the type `corrective`. The process is very similar to uploading an invoice, use the [Create an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) endpoint to upload a corrective invoice. Include an [invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) object in the [data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put#body-data), with these required fields:

    - `regime`: `ES`
    - Add the [`es-verifactu-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/es-verifactu-v1) addon
    - `supplier_id`: use the same supplier details as in the original invoice
    - `type`: `corrective`
    - `preceding`: references the original invoice, within it, you must include:
      - `uuid`: the UUID of the original invoice (optional but recommended)
      - `type`: type of the original invoice
      - `issue_date`: the date of the original invoice
      - `series`: the series of the original invoice
      - `code`: the code of the original invoice
      - `tax`: the tax section of the original invoice, you can copy it from the original invoice

  You can copy the example corrective invoice below as a reference.

	<CorrectiveInvoice />

  After successful upload, you'll see the corrective invoice in the **Invoices** section with status `Empty`. If you've included the `uuid` of the invoice in preceding, you'll see a link to the corrective invoice we've just created in the _Related_ tab of the invoice.

    <Frame caption="Link to the corrective invoice">
      <img
        width="600"
        src="/assets/guides/es-verifactu-invoice-corrective.png"
        alt="Invoice related to a corrective invoice"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Corrective Invoice to the VERI*FACTU invoice workflow">
    Send the corrective invoice to the VERI\*FACTU workflow using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint. Use:

    - `workflow_id`: use the Workflow ID of the _VERI\*FACTU invoice_ workflow we created during setup
    - `silo_entry_id`: use the The Silo Entry ID of the corrective invoice you've just uploaded.

    The corrective invoice's status will change to `Sent` when the workflow completes successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cancel an Invoice

VERI\*FACTU also allows you to cancel an invoice. In general, you should only cancel an invoice if it hasn't been handed to the customer nor accepted by the tax authority.

Different from a credit note or a corrective, canceling an invoice doesn't produce a second document, which means you don't have a paper to hand to your customer to show the cancellation. That's why, if the invoice has been handed to the customer, we recommend issuing a credit note instead.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a cancel invoice workflow (only once)">
    To cancel an invoice, you need a workflow with the _Cancel invoice_ step. You can start with the template below.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template">
        <Card title="VERI*FACTU cancel invoice workflow" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=es-verifactu-cancel" cta="Add to my workspace">
          This workflow will cancel a VERI\*FACTU document.
        </Card>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Code">
        Copy and paste into a new [Empty Party workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-party) code view.

        <CancelInvoice />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Build from scratch">
        Before starting, review the [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the general setup process.

        In [Console](https://console.invopop.com), create a new workflow and choose [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) as the base. Then name the workflow with a descriptive label such as "VERI\*FACTU Cancel Invoice".

        We recommend adding the following steps:

        1. **Cancel invoice** - Cancels the VERI\*FACTU document.
        2. **Set State** - select _Void_ in the step configuration. This will set the state of the invoice to `Void`.
        3. In the Error Handling area, **Set State** - select `Error` in the step configuration.

        Add any additional steps you may need, and save the new workflow.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to cancellation workflow">
    To cancel an invoice, simply send it to the VERI\*FACTU cancel invoice workflow created earlier using the [Create a job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoint.

    The invoice's status will change to `Void` when the workflow completes successfully.
  </Step>
