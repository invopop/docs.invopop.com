Belgium handles e-invoicing through the Peppol network, which will become **mandatory starting January 2026**. For comprehensive information about Peppol features and capabilities, please refer to our [Peppol Features Guide](/guides/features/peppol).

## First-Time Peppol Registration

If this is your first time registering for Peppol in Belgium, you will need to request a migration key from [BOSA](https://bosa.belgium.be/) (Belgian Federal Public Service Policy and Support, FPS BOSA). This requires setting up a migration workflow **instead of the standard registration workflow** with the following steps:

### Migration Process

1. **Fetch Migration Key** - Request and obtain your migration key from BOSA
2. **Migration Step** - Use the migration key to migrate your information to our SMP (Service Metadata Publisher)

**Note:** You will still need to complete the proof of ownership process as described in the [Peppol Features Guide](/guides/features/peppol), but you should use the migration workflow instead of the standard registration workflow for the initial setup.

This migration process ensures that your organization's information is properly transferred and registered within the Peppol network for Belgian e-invoicing compliance.

For detailed instructions on proof of ownership and general Peppol setup, please consult the [Peppol Features Guide](/guides/features/peppol).
