## Introduction

This guide will show you how to configure the **Send Webhook** workflow step to send HTTP requests automatically from your workflows. You can use webhooks to notify external systems, trigger automations, or synchronize data with third-party APIs whenever an event occurs.

Included in this guide are the configuration options for the "Send Webhook" workflow step, a sample response with an explanation for each field, and the procedure for retries.

## Setup and configuration

Add the **Send Webhook** step to your workflow by searching or locating it in the actions list under the **Notify** section.

Then configure your Webhook:

</Frame>

**Webhook URL**<br />
The endpoint that will receive the `POST` request.

**Event (optional)**<br />
Specify a custom event name such as `success`, `error`, or `invoice_sent`. This will appear under the `event` field in the JSON payload.

**Authentication Bearer Token (optional)**<br />
If your endpoint requires authorization, include a token here. The request will include a header: `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`. Invopop does not recommend whitelisting IPs for security as the static IP is likely to change in the future.

<Warning>Never expose sensitive credentials directly in the webhook URL. Always use Bearer Tokens or custom headers for secure authentication.</Warning>

**Custom Headers (optional)**<br />
Add one or more HTTP headers. This is useful for services that require API keys, content types, or verification signatures.

**Sample Body**<br />
Below is an example of the JSON payload that will be sent:

```json
{
  "id": "",
  "event": "",
  "transform_job_id": "",
  "silo_entry_id": "",
  "owner_id": "",
  "key": "",
  "meta": {},
  "faults": []
}
```

- `id` the id of the webhook event.
- `event` custom event name set up in the step (if any).
- `transform_job_id`  the id of a job run through the [Transform Job endpoint](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/transform/jobs/fetch-a-job-by-key)
- `silo_entry_id` the id of the [silo entry](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/silo/entries/fetch-an-entry)
- `key` the job's [key](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put#body-key) to ensure [idempotency](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/idempotency).
- `meta` certain workflow steps can add data to the meta field which is then made available to subsequent steps and to webhook payloads.
- `faults` array of [fault](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/transform/jobs/fetch-a-job#response-faults) objects that represent errors that occurred during the processing of the job.

<Info> The webhook will expect a `200` or `204` response code. Any other response will be treated as an error and will be automatically retried after a delay. </Info>

## Retries

When a webhook is triggered, Invopop will wait for a response. The behavior is as follows:

* Success (`200`/`204`) → Webhook will produce an `OK` status and no retry process will be triggered.
* Anything else → Webhook will trigger the retry process.

Retries happen automatically using exponential backoff for error messages in jobs:
5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 80s → … doubling up to 1,280s. Subsequently, the system will wait 30 minutes between retries until a maximum of 12 hours is reached.

If you wish to change this behavior, include a `retry_in` field in your response with the number of seconds you wish to wait between retries. The system will then retry up to 32 times returning a `KO` status code. Here is an example of such a response:

```
{
  "code":"503",
  "message":"Service Unavailable",
  "retry_in": 20
}
```

## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What happens if my webhook endpoint is down?">
        If your endpoint fails to respond or returns a non-`200`/`204` status code, Invopop will retry automatically. If the
        error persists, the webhook step will return a `KO` status.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I send multiple webhooks in the same workflow?">
        Yes. You can add multiple **Send Webhook** actions in the same workflow, each targeting a different endpoint or event.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What security options are available?">
        You can authenticate using Bearer Tokens or custom headers (e.g. `X-Signature`, `X-API-Key`). It’s recommended to use HTTPS and verify the token or header server-side.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What content type do webhooks use?">
        All webhook requests are sent with `Content-Type: application/json`.
