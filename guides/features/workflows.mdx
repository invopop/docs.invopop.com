## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Invopop is a sequence of steps executed for each incoming job. Each step is powered by the provider of a service. Examples of services include:

* Generating PDFs
* Forwarding invoices to tax agencies
* Modifying documents
* Sending emails
* Posting webhooks
* Sending documents to ERPs or other systems

Workflows automate and streamline your document processes. Invopop ensures each step is executed reliably, with built-in retries and error handling.

## How to create a Workflow

Although workflows can be created via the API, we strongly recommend using the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) for an easier set up.


In the **Workflows** section click on **Create Workflow**. You will see a template selection screen. The first items are blank workflows for each document type:

- **Empty Invoice workflow**: for sales or expenses.
- **Empty Party workflow**: for suppliers or customers.
- **Empty Payments workflow**: for payments or receipts.
- **Empty Order workflow**: for purchase or sales orders.
- **Empty Delivery workflow**: for delivery notes.

Choose [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop-staging.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) for this example and then click **Load Template**.


Give your workflow a name and description by filling the fields on the right sidebar.

Add steps to your new workflow by tapping on the **+ Add step** button and selecting an action from the right. Some steps will require configuration in order to function correctly.

The "developer mode" switch at the top right of the canvas can be used to display the JSON representation of the workflow. This makes it easy to copy and paste workflows from examples or other workspaces. Make sure to return to the visual editor view to ensure the document is validated.

## Running a Workflow

Workflows in Invopop are executed:

- Manually via the Invopop Console
- Via API calls to the [create job endpoint](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put)
- Automatically by an embedded application.

Before a job can be executed you must [upload the data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) you'll be working with to the "silo" as a "silo entry".

As a job is executed, the silo entry will be updated with any changes or attachments generated during processing.

The status of a job can be seen in the silo entry's activity tab, or in the **Workflows** â†’ **History** section accessible from the left sidebar.

## Error Handling

Any error that causes a `KO` (an error from which the workflow can't recover) will trigger error handling in a workflow. To enable this section, tap on **Handle Errors** at the bottom of the workflow creation screen. To add actions into this section select an action from the list, or drag steps into the **Error Handling** area.
