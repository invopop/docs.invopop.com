## Introduction

The objective of this guide is to walk you through the process of generating a simple PDF invoice you can send to your customers. This is valid for tax regimes that don't require any electronic reporting or invoicing, and serves as a useful example from which to create your own workflows.

Once completed, the workflow will work with any GOBL invoice produced for any country in the world.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following data to issue basic PDF invoices:

- Supplier details - fiscal details of who is issuing.
- Customer details - fiscal details of who is receiving for B2B invoices.
- List of products or services being sold, including quantities and prices.
- Know what taxes and rates apply.
- Have chosen a "series" for the invoice, a few alphanumerical characters to help group invoices together.

## Setup

Issuing PDF invoices with Invopop requires very little preparation. We assume that you already have access to the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) and know how to [create a workflow](/guides/features/workflows).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Template">
    <Card iconType="duotone" title="PDF Workflow Template" icon="code-branch" href="https://console.invopop.com">
  Open in Console â†’
  </Card>
  In the next screen you will select the workspace where you want to create this workflow.

  ***
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code">


  Copy and paste into a new **Blank Invoice workflow** code view.
  <WF_PDF_JSON />

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from scratch">
    In [Console](https://console.invopop.com) create a new workflow and select **Empty Invoice workflow** in the template selector, then add the following steps:

1. **Add Sequential Code** - select the **dynamic** sequence option, set the name, and check the **Sign document** checkbox
2. **Generate PDF** - choose any settings you like

That's all there is to it.

## Running

Use the following example GOBL Invoices inside the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) or via the API to create new silo entries. Once a silo entry has been stored, you can create a new job to run the "PDF Invoice" workflow you just created.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I customize the format of PDF?">

<Frame>
<img src="/guides/images/pdf-config.png" width="360px" alt="Generate PDF configuration" />
</Frame>
You can view all available customizations for the PDF in the configuration of the Generate PDF step.

To add a logo to the invoice, you can either upload it directly in the Generate PDF step or include a URL for the logo in the invoice payload by adding the "logos" field to the supplier.
