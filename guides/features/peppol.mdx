## Introduction

[Peppol (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line)](https://peppol.org/) is a global network for electronic document exchange, widely adopted for e-invoicing across multiple countries. It provides a standardized protocol for companies to exchange business documents like invoices, credit notes, and purchase orders.

The Peppol network is particularly popular in:

- Nordic countries (Norway, Finland)
- Asia-Pacific region (Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand)
- Several EU countries for business-to-government invoicing (Germany, Italy, Croatia)

Invopop allows you to send and receive documents through the Peppol network using a single integration while continuing to work with our [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org/introduction) format.

This guide walks you through the steps to register a company in Invopop and then issue and receive invoices on its behalf.

## Setup
Let's prepare your workspace to work with Peppol. We'll configure the Peppol app and create three [workflows](/guides/features/workflows):

- **Invoice issuance workflow**: Send invoices through the Peppol network
- **Invoice reception workflow**: Receive invoices from the Peppol network
- **Party registration workflow**: Programmatically onboard companies (Parties) with Invopop

If you only want to _send_ invoices through Peppol, you can skip step 3 and 4 of the setup. Alternatively, if you only want to _receive_ invoices through Peppol, you can skip step 2.

The Peppol app is designed to only send and receive the document, generating and importing the appropriate file is delegated to format specific apps such as Oasis UBL or UN/CEFACT CII. This is done to keep the Peppol app simple and focused on the Peppol protocol, while allowing you to use the format that best suits your needs.

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the Peppol app">
1. Within the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/), navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**
2. Find the **Peppol** app in the list
3. Click **Connect** to activate it. The Peppol app should now appear in the list of Enabled apps

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure a workflow to issue invoices">
Now we'll create the workflow that converts invoices to a valid Peppol format and sends them through the Peppol network. In this example, we'll generate a Peppol BIS Billing UBL 3.0 document.

Skip this step if you only want to _receive_ invoices via Peppol.

    Use the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/) to build a [workflow](/guides/features/workflows) of the Invoice type. Include these essential steps:

    1. **Set State** - to `Processing`.
    2. **Sign Envelope** - Signs the GOBL document (can be substituted with `Add Sequential Code` with the `Sign Document` option enabled)
    3. **Generate UBL document** - Converts the GOBL document to a Peppol BIS Billing UBL 3.0 document and attaches it to the original invoice entry.
    4. **Send Peppol document** - Sends the generated XML attachment through the Peppol network
    5. **Set State** - to `Sent`.

    Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure a Party registration workflow">
This workflow onboards companies (Peppol participants) to Invopop before they can issue or receive invoices. If you're managing your own invoices only, you may use this workflow just once. However, if you're offering Peppol to your customers through Invopop ([white-label use case](/guides/use-cases/white-label)), you'll run this workflow for each merchant you onboard.

      This workflow is composed by these steps:

      1. **Register for Approval** - This generates a link to the registration wizard where proof of ownership will be collected.
      2. **Set State** - select `Processing`.
      3. **Wait for Approval** - Invopop will validate the company identity and ownership. This can take up to 72 hours.
      4. **Register Peppol Party** - Complete the normal registration process after approval.
      5. **Set State** - select `Registered`.

      Finally, in the Error Handling area, add the **Set State** action and select `Error`.


  </Tab>

</Step>

</Steps>

Congratulations! Your workspace is now configured to send and receive Peppol documents and programmatically onboard Peppol participants with Invopop.

## Running

After setup, you can perform three key operations with Peppol in Invopop: onboarding entities (parties) so they can use Peppol, sending invoices through Peppol, and receiving Peppol invoices.

### Registering parties

Business entities are represented in Invopop as GOBL org.party objects, which we call Parties.

Peppol requires Invopop to collect proof of ownership for regulatory compliance. As outlined in [Section 3.3 End user Identification of the Internal Regulations II document](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/3963191334/Internal+Regulations), key details such as VAT number, address, contact information, and company name must be provided and validated during registration.

To register a party:

1. Upload it to the Silo with required company information
2. Send it to the party registration workflow

#### Upload a party document

You can upload parties via the [Create an Entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) API endpoint or manually through the Console. For this guide, we'll demonstrate the manual process:

1. Find the **Contacts** section in the sidebar and click **Suppliers**
2. Click **+ New Supplier** to open the editor
3. Enter the required information (or use the example below)

The mandatory fields for Peppol registration are:

- Company name (fiscal name)
- VAT number (tax ID)
- Complete company address
- Contact information
- Peppol participant ID

Participant IDs are a way to identify an entity in the Peppol network. In most cases they are based on the VAT number or a local ID. They are composed of a scheme and a code. The scheme identifies the type of code used. For example, a Spanish Vat number uses code 9920 but the Belgian BCE uses code 0208. Then the code is the actual number. Most countries have a default code they use which is why we can usually determine the Participant ID from the Tax ID. We represent these IDs in a Party using an inbox as thats what it really represent, an address in the network for invoices to be sent to and from. The key is there to help clarify the use and if multiple inboxes are provided, the one with the key will take precedence.

If no Peppol participant ID is provided, Invopop will assign one during registration based on the VAT number and the country.

All fields are required for identity validation and proof of ownership verification.

Click **Build** to validate the document, then **Save**.

<PeppolSupplier />

#### Send to the registration workflow

Once the document is saved:

1. Click the **Select Workflow** button
2. Select the **Register Supplier** workflow created during setup
3. Click **Run Workflow**

The execution should succeed, and the silo entry's state will change to "Processing." The first step creates a registration link that you can extract from the **Meta** tab or via the API:

<Frame>
<img width="100%" src="/guides/images/peppol-supplier.png" alt="Sending party to the registration workflow" />
</Frame>

This link leads to a web form where you can upload proof of ownership documents and confirm your company details:

<Frame>
<img width="100%" src="/guides/images/peppol-wizard.png" alt="Peppol registration wizard" />
</Frame>

After submitting the web form, Invopop will be notified and will validate your information within up to 72 hours. The approval status will be shown in the Meta tab of the entry.

#### Programmatic registration (white-label)

For programmatic integration, you can use our API instead of the web form. This is particularly useful for white-label implementations where you want to integrate the registration process into your own application.

You can achieve this by uploading the proof of ownership document using the [API](/api-ref/apps/peppol/ownership-upload). This launches the validation process automatically.

#### Completion

When Invopop approves your registration, we will automatically register your party with the Peppol network as before. You'll see the Peppol Participant ID in the Meta tab of the entry, and the GOBL document will contain an `inboxes` array.

<Frame caption="Peppol participant inboxes">
  <img src="/guides/images/peppol-inboxes.png" width="500" alt="Peppol inboxes" />
</Frame>

Participant IDs are represented as inboxes within a Party record because they function as network addresses—the location where invoices are sent to and received from. 

To set a primary inbox when multiple are configured, add "key: peppol" to your preferred inbox. This inbox will take precedence for all Peppol transactions.

The party can now send and/or receive invoices in Peppol via Invopop.

#### Unregistering a participant

If you need to unregister an entity (because the supplier is no longer your client, for example), use the following workflow template:

<PeppolUnregisterWorkflow />



### Sending invoices

To send an invoice, you need to store it as a Silo Entry with the

1. Store it as a [Silo Entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) with the Peppol inboxes previously obtained.
2. Send it to the Sending Invoice Workflow created during setup

You can perform these steps manually via the Console or programmatically via the API using the [Create an Entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) and [Create a Job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post) endpoints. For API usage, refer to our [quickstart guide](/api-ref/introduction).

When creating your invoice, ensure you add the `eu-en16931-v2017` addon to enable validations and extensions needed for Peppol

<PeppolInvoice />

<Note>
  The `payment: { "terms": {"detail": "..."}}` field is required for [EN16931](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/spaces/DIGITAL/pages/467108950/EN+16931+compliance) (EU) invoices and should be filled in with due dates or payment terms.
</Note>


### Receiving invoices

Invopop automatically processes invoices received from the Peppol network using your configured _Incoming Workflow_.

The workflow converts Peppol documents to GOBL format and creates Silo Entries for each invoice. Configure your workflow with webhooks or Google Drive integration to deliver these invoices to your systems.

## FAQ

Please contact the [Invopop support team](mailto:support@invopop.com) if you have any questions that are not listed here.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What visibility do I need to have in my Peppol Party?">
The visibility of your Peppol Party determines what documents you can send and receive.

- `smp`: Only SMP, should be used for testing
- `smp+sml`: SMP and SML, useful when you want to send documents but not receive them
- `smp+sml+peppol`: SMP, SML, and Peppol Directory, recommended for both sending and receiving documents as you will be visible in the Peppol Directory

In general, you should use the highest visibility available.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remove UBL or CII from the 'Peppol receive invoice' workflow if I only use one format?">
Yes, you can remove either format based on your needs. Our template includes both UBL and CII imports for comprehensiveness, but if you're certain you'll only receive invoices in one format, you can safely remove the unused format. This simplifies your workflow and reduces the number of apps you need to activate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Participant IDs?">

Participant IDs are unique identifiers for entities in the Peppol network. They consist of two parts:

- **Scheme**: Identifies the type of identifier being used (e.g., 9920 for Spanish VAT numbers, 0208 for Belgian BCE numbers)
- **Code**: The actual identification number

In most cases, Participant IDs are based on VAT numbers or local business identifiers. Since most countries have a default scheme, we can typically derive the Participant ID automatically from a Tax ID.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When registering a supplier we get an error: 'XXXX:XXXXXXXXX is already registered' on the Register Peppol Party step">
This is because because a supplier with the stated participant ID has already been registered in your workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I set the $regime in Peppol?">
  By default, the regime is automatically determined from each supplier's settings, which is recommended in Peppol.
</Accordion>
