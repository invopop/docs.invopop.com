## Introduction

[Peppol (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line)](https://peppol.org/) is a global network for electronic document exchange, widely adopted for e-invoicing across multiple countries. It provides a standardized protocol for companies to exchange business documents like invoices, credit notes, and purchase orders.

The Peppol network is particularly popular in:

- Nordic countries (Norway, Finland)
- Asia-Pacific region (Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand)
- Several EU countries for business-to-government invoicing (Germany, Italy, Croatia)

Invopop allows you to send and receive documents through the Peppol network using a single integration while continuing to work with our [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org/introduction) format.

This guide walks you through the steps to register a company in Invopop and then issue and receive invoices on its behalf.

## Setup
Let's prepare your workspace to work with Peppol. We'll configure the Peppol app and create three [workflows](/guides/features/workflows.mdx):

- **Invoice issuance workflow**: Send invoices through the Peppol network
- **Invoice reception workflow**: Receive invoices from the Peppol network
- **Party registration workflow**: Programmatically onboard companies (Parties) with Invopop

If you only want to _send_ invoices through Peppol, you can skip step 3 and 4 of the setup. Alternatively, if you only want to _receive_ invoices through Peppol, you can skip step 2.

The Peppol app is designed to only send and receive the document, generating and importing the appropriate file is delegated to format specific apps such as Oasis UBL or UN/CEFACT CII. This is done to keep the Peppol app simple and focused on the Peppol protocol, while allowing you to use the format that best suits your needs.

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the Peppol app">
1. Within the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/), navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**
2. Find the **Peppol** app in the list
3. Click **Connect** to activate it. The Peppol app should now appear in the list of Enabled apps

<Frame>
<img width="450" src="/guides/images/peppol-app.png" alt="Connect Peppol app" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure a workflow to issue invoices">
Now we'll create the workflow that converts invoices to a valid Peppol format and sends them through the Peppol network. In this example, we'll generate a Peppol BIS Billing UBL 3.0 document.

Skip this step if you only want to _receive_ invoices via Peppol.

Use the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/) to build a [workflow](/guides/features/workflows.mdx) of the Invoice type. Include these essential steps:

1. **Sign Envelope** - Signs the GOBL document (can be substituted with `Add Sequential Code` with the `Sign Document` option enabled)
2. **Generate UBL document** - Converts the GOBL document to a Peppol BIS Billing UBL 3.0 document and attaches it to the original invoice entry.
3. **Send Peppol document** - Sends the generated XML attachment through the Peppol network

You can copy-paste the workflow template below into your workspace.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure a workflow to receive invoices">
This workflow receives incoming documents from the Peppol network and converts them to the GOBL format.

Use the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/) to build a workflow of the Invoice type and include the following steps:

- **Import Peppol Document** - Fetches the document from the Peppol network
- **Import UBL Document** - Parses the incoming document from the underlying format (e.g. UBL) to GOBL

We recommend adding a _Send Webhook_ step at the end to receive notifications for incoming invoices.

<PeppolReceiveWorkflow />
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Peppol app">
Within the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/), navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**, find the Peppol App and click **Configure**. You'll need to set two fields:

- **Incoming Workflow**: Select the Receive Invoice Workflow created in Step 3. This is where the app will send incoming invoices (expenses) received from the Peppol network.
</Step>


<Step title="Configure a Party registration workflow">
This workflow onboards companies (Peppol participants) to Invopop before they can issue or receive invoices. If you're managing only your own invoices, you may use this workflow just once. However, if you're offering Peppol to your customers through Invopop ([white-label use case](/guides/use-cases/white-label.mdx)), you'll run this workflow for each merchant you onboard.

Within the [Console](https://console.invopop.com/), navigate to **Workflows** → **New Workflow** and create a _Parties_ workflow. Include at least the _Register Peppol Party_ step, along with any other relevant actions such as state-handling and webhooks.

Alternatively, copy-paste the workflow template below into your workspace.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: Party Registration Workflow">

<PeppolRegisterWorkflow />
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Frame>
<img width="450" src="/guides/images/peppol-register.png" alt="Party Registration Workflow" />
</Frame>
As you can see, the _Register Peppol Party_ step also has a few configuration options depending on the formats you want to work with and if you want to send, receive or both.
</Step>

</Steps>

Congratulations! Your workspace is now configured to send and receive Peppol documents and programmatically onboard Peppol participants with Invopop.

## Running

After setup, you can perform three key operations with Peppol in Invopop: onboarding entities (parties) so they can use Peppol, sending invoices through Peppol, and receiving Peppol invoices.

### Registering parties

Business entities are represented in Invopop as GOBL org.party objects, which we call Parties. To register a party:

1. Upload it to the Silo
2. Send it to the party registration workflow

#### Upload a party document

You can upload parties via the [Create an Entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put.mdx) API endpoint or manually through the Console. For this guide, we'll demonstrate the manual process:

1. Find the **Contacts** section in the sidebar and click **Suppliers**
2. Click **+ New Supplier** to open the editor
3. Enter the required information (or use the example below)

The mandatory fields for Peppol registration are:

- Fiscal name
- Peppol participant ID

_Tax ID is optional, but recommended._

Click **Build** to validate the document, then **Save**.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: Supplier">
<PeppolSupplier />
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Send to the registration workflow

Once the document is saved:

1. Click the **Select Workflow** button
2. Select the **Register Supplier** workflow created during setup
3. Click **Run Workflow**

The execution should succeed, and the silo entry's state will change to "Processing." Click the **Meta** tab to see the registration link:

<Frame>
<img width="450" src="/guides/images/peppol-supplier.png" alt="Sending party to the registration workflow" />
</Frame>

When successful, you'll see the Peppol Participant ID in the Meta tab of the entry. The party can now send and/or receive invoices in Peppol via Invopop.

### Sending invoices

To send an invoice, you need to:

1. Store it as a [Silo Entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put.mdx)
2. Send it to the Sending Invoice Workflow created during setup

You can perform these steps manually via the Console or programmatically via the API using the [Create an Entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put.mdx) and [Create a Job](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-post.mdx) endpoints. For API usage, refer to our [quickstart guide](/api-ref/introduction.mdx).

When creating your invoice, ensure you:

1. Set the appropriate `$regime` field based on the issuer's country (e.g., `NO` for Norway, `FI` for Finland)
2. Add the `peppol` addon to enable Peppol-specific validations and extensions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: Peppol Invoice">
<PeppolInvoice />
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Receiving invoices

Invopop automatically processes invoices received from the Peppol network using your configured _Incoming Workflow_.

The workflow converts Peppol documents to GOBL format and creates Silo Entries for each invoice. Configure your workflow with webhooks or Google Drive integration to deliver these invoices to your systems.

## FAQ

Please contact the [Invopop support team](email:support@invopop.com) if you have any questions that are not listed here.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What visibility do I need to have in my Peppol Party?">
The visibility of your Peppol Party determines what documents you can send and receive.

- `smp`: Only SMP
- `smp+sml`: SMP and SML
- `smp+sml+peppol`: SMP, SML, and Peppol

In general, you should use the highest visibility available. If you are only sending documents, no visibility is required.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I disable Peppol for a Party?">
You can disable Peppol for a Party by running a workflow with the _Register Peppol Party_ step and setting the Status to `Disabled`.
