## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Invopop is essentially a list of steps that are executed sequentially for an incoming _job_. Each step in a workflow is linked to a provider of a specific service, such as:

- generating a PDF,
- forwarding invoices to an external tax agency,
- modifying documents,
- sending emails,
- posting webhooks,
- forwarding documents to ERPs or other systems, etc.

Workflows allow you to automate and streamline processes related to document handling. Invopop handles the complexity of ensuring that every step is executed using retries and error handling.

## How to create a Workflow

While it is possible to create workflows via the API, we recommend using the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) as the UI will help you correctly define and configure each of the different steps.

<Steps>

<Step title="Goto the workflows section">
  Use the sidebar and click on the **Workflows** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Click new workflow">
  You'll be presented with a modal to start creating the new workflow.
</Step>

<Step title="Select document type">
There are currently two document types:

- **Invoices** - sales or expenses.
- **Contacts** - suppliers or customers.

Choose **Invoices** for this example.

</Step>
<Step title="Click Create Workflow">
This will save the new workflow and present the empty workflow editor screen.
</Step>

</Steps>

Give your workflow a name for easy identification, like "Process Invoice" by clicking on the pencil symbol in the top bar.

Add steps to your new workflow by clicking on the **+** button and selecting an action from the right. Some steps will require configuration in order to function correctly.

The "developer mode" switch at the top right can be used to display the workflow as a JSON document. This makes it really easy to copy and paste workflows from examples or other workspaces. Just be sure to return to the visual editor view to ensure the document is validated.

## Running a Workflow

Workflows in Invopop are executed:

- manually via the invopop console,
- via API calls to the [create job endpoint](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put), or,
- automatically by an embedded application.

Before a job can be executed however, you need to [upload the data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) you'll be working with to the "silo" as a "silo entry".

As a job is executed, the silo entry will be updated with any changes or attachments generated during processing.

The status of a job can be seen in the silo entry's activity tab, or in the **Workflows** - **History** section accessible from the left sidebar.
