## Introduction

**Facturae** is Spain's official XML invoice format for **Business-to-Government (B2G)** transactions. The current version is **Facturae 3.2.2**, and invoices are submitted to public administrations through the [FACe](https://face.gob.es/) platform.

Facturae is required when invoicing any Spanish public administration body (central government, regional governments, local councils, etc.). Unlike other Spanish tax reporting systems (VERI\*FACTU, SII), Facturae does not require supplier registration — you simply generate the XML and submit it.

## Prerequisites

To generate Facturae invoices, ensure you have:

- An invoice with:
  - Supplier details (company name, tax ID, full address). Check the [Spanish](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/es) regime for specifics.
  - Line items with name, price, and applicable taxes.

## Facturae Setup

To generate Facturae invoices, follow these instructions in the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com):

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect the Spain app">

1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Apps**.
2. Locate **Spain** in the app discovery list.
3. Click **Connect** to activate.

No additional configuration is needed.

<Step title="Configure invoice workflow">

  <Tab title="Template">
    <Card iconType="duotone" title="Facturae Generate Invoice" icon="code-branch" href="https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=es-facturae" cta="Add to my workspace">

    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code">
    Copy and paste into a new [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) code view.
    <FacturaeWorkflow />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from scratch">

    First, review our [workflows guide](/guides/features/workflows) to understand the basics.

    In [Console](https://console.invopop.com) create a new workflow and select [Empty Invoice workflow](https://console.invopop.com/redirect/workflows/new?template=empty-invoice) in the template selector, then add the essential steps:

    1. **Add Sequential Code**: Assigns a sequential code to the invoice.
    2. **Sign Envelope**: The envelope must be signed before processing.
    3. **Generate Facturae XML**: Produces the Facturae 3.2.2 XML document.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Administrative Centers (DIR3 Codes)

<Info>
When invoicing Spanish **public administrations** via FACe, you must include three administrative centers identified by their **DIR3 codes**. Each public body publishes these codes in the [DIR3 directory](https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/ctt/dir3).
</Info>

The three required roles and their corresponding GOBL fields are:

| Facturae Role | Code | GOBL Field |
|---|---|---|
| **Oficina Contable** (Accounting Office) | `01` | `customer.identities[]` with `scope: "tax"` |
| **Órgano Gestor** (Managing Body) | `02` | `delivery.receiver.identities[0]` |
| **Unidad Tramitadora** (Processing Unit) | `03` | `ordering.buyer.identities[0]` |

See the FACe example below for a complete invoice with all three administrative centers.

## Running

Use the following example GOBL documents to generate Facturae invoices.

<ExampleAccordion />

<Info>
  In your invoice data, make sure to include the [`es-facturae-v3` addon](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/es-facturae-v3) and set the regime to `ES`.
</Info>

Once you have saved in Invopop, select <kbd>Run workflow</kbd> and select "Facturae Generate Invoice" from the sidebar.
