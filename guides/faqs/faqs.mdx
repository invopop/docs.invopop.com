  <Accordion title="How should tax be calculated on invoices: at the line item level or at the invoice level?">

    If tax is calculated and rounded at the line item level, the total tax amount may be less than what is required when calculated at the invoice level. For example, three line items each with a net value of 1.01 would result in a total tax of 0.66 when calculated per line, but 0.67 when calculated at the invoice level. This discrepancy could lead to validation issues.
