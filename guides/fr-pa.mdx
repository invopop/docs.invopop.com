  While Invopop has been approved as a PA platform, the service is not yet available as we continue developing and preparing for the mandatory implementation date.
</Note>

France handles e-invoicing through approved PA (_Plateforme Agréée_) platforms as part of its electronic invoicing reform. Invopop is an officially approved PA platform, as listed on the [French government's official list of approved platforms](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/je-consulte-la-liste-des-plateformes-agreees.

## Official Approval Status

Invopop is _Plateforme Agréée_ (Approved Platform) by the French tax administration, meaning we have successfully provided all necessary documentation for the registration procedure and passed the technical compliance verification.

The approval process consists of two stages:

1. **Registration under reserve** - ✅ **Completed** - Invopop has provided all required documentation and passed the initial approval stage
2. **Technical compliance verification** - ✅ **Completed** - Invopop has verified technical compliance with specifications including platform-to-platform invoice exchange and data extraction capabilities

## PA and Peppol Network

The French PA system relies on the [Peppol network](/guides/features/peppol) infrastructure with additional French-specific requirements. This creates a "five corner model" for e-invoicing compliance:

1. **Supplier** - Issues the invoice
2. **Supplier's PA** - Processes and transmits the invoice
3. **DGFiP (French Tax Administration)** - Receives mandatory invoice data and status updates
4. **Customer's PA** - Receives and processes the invoice
5. **Customer** - Receives the final invoice

## What This Means for You

As an approved PA platform, Invopop will:

- **Issue** electronic invoices through the Peppol network with French compliance
- **Transmit** invoices to other PA platforms via Peppol infrastructure
- **Send mandatory data** to DGFiP for each invoice as required by French law
- **Report status updates** to DGFiP throughout the invoice life cycle
- **Handle annuaire (French e-invoicing directory) registration** for French e-invoicing directory compliance
- **Receive** electronic invoices from other approved platforms
- **Extract** necessary data for tax administration purposes

## Getting Started

French e-invoicing via PA platforms will become mandatory starting **September 2026**. While Invopop is already approved as a PA platform, the service is not yet available as we continue developing and preparing for the mandatory implementation date.

We will update this guide with detailed setup instructions and configuration details as we approach the launch date. In the meantime, you can familiarize yourself with our [Peppol guide](/guides/features/peppol), as the French PA system builds upon the Peppol network infrastructure.
