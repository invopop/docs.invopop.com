### Set up a payment method and live workspace

<Steps>

    From the Console, click on your avatar (bottom left) and select **Configure \{organization\_name\}**.

        alt="Configure Organization"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Billing Account">
  	In the left-hand menu, click on *Billing*, then on *Create Billing Account* (top right). Fill in your details and click on **Save**. A Stripe page will open.

        alt="VERI*FACTU app connected"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your payment method and billing details">
			On the Stripe page:

			* Add a payment method (card or direct debit) with *Add a payment method*
			* Enter your tax information with *Update information*

        src="/assets/guides/go-live-stripe.png"
        alt="Stripe screenshot"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your production environment (Live Workspace)">
			Once you introduce your payment details on Stripe you will return to the billing accounts screen. Click on **Workspaces** (in the side menu), then on *New workspace*. Assign a name, select the **Live** type and the billing account you just created. Click *Create workspace*.
  	 <Frame caption="Create your live workspace">

        src="/assets/guides/go-live-new-workspace.png"
        alt="Create your live workspace"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

</Steps>

#### All set!

Your production environment is now configured. From the Console, you should see your new *Live Workspace* in the selector (top left). If it doesn't appear, reload the page. If the issue persists, contact us at **[support@invopop.com](mailto:support@invopop.com)**.
