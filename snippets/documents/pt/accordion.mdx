	<Accordion title="AT B2B invoice">

		In this example, we're issuing a simple invoice from a Portuguese supplier to another Portuguese business.

		Notice:

		- the minimal version (`at-b2b.min.mdx`) contains only the essential fields required to create the invoice,
		- the [`pt-saft-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1) addon ensures the document will be validated and normalized using the SAF-T PT v1 rules built into the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) library,
		- the `supplier` and `series` fields are set to example values; you'll need to replace them with the details of supplier and series registered as per the previous sections. The series must be registered in the Supplier Portal and follow Portuguese naming conventions (see [Series Management](/guides/pt-at#series-management) for details),
		- when running `gobl build`, the system automatically calculates totals, assigns the [`pt-saft-invoice-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#invoice-type) extension to `FT` (Fatura), sets the [`pt-saft-payment-means`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#payment-means) extension to `CC` for card payment, and applies the [`pt-saft-tax-rate`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#tax-rate-code) extension to `NOR` for standard VAT,
		- the built version (`at-b2b.mdx`) shows the normalized document with calculated totals, line item sums (including advance payment deductions), tax breakdowns, and automatically generated fields,
		- the `h` item unit causes the [`pt-saft-product-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#product-type) extension to be set to `S` (Serviço), and the [`pt-region`](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/pt#region-code) extension is automatically set to `PT`, and,
		- there are no totals or calculations in the minimal version; all these will be made automatically when uploading.

	<Accordion title="AT delivery note">

		In this example, we're issuing a delivery note from a Portuguese supplier to another Portuguese receiver.

		Notice:

		- the minimal version (`delivery.min.mdx`) contains only the essential fields required to create the delivery document,
		- the [`pt-saft-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1) addon ensures the document will be validated and normalized using the SAF-T PT v1 rules built into the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) library,
		- the `supplier` and `series` fields are set to example values; you'll need to replace them with the details of supplier and series registered as per the previous sections. The series must be registered in the Supplier Portal and follow Portuguese naming conventions (see [Series Management](/guides/pt-at#series-management) for details),
		- this is an `advice` document type with the [`pt-saft-movement-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#movement-type) extension set to `GR` (Guia de Remessa),
		- when running `gobl build`, the system automatically calculates totals, applies the standard VAT rate with the [`pt-saft-tax-rate`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#tax-rate-code) extension set to `NOR`, and normalizes all fields,
		- the built version (`delivery.mdx`) shows the normalized document with calculated totals, line item sums, tax breakdowns, and automatically generated fields,
		- the [`pt-region`](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/pt#region-code) extension is automatically set to `PT`, and,

	<Accordion title="AT payment receipt">

		In this example, we're issuing a payment receipt from a Portuguese supplier to another Portuguese business.

		Notice:

		- the minimal version (`payment.min.mdx`) contains only the essential fields required to create the payment document,
		- the [`pt-saft-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1) addon ensures the document will be validated and normalized using the SAF-T PT v1 rules built into the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) library,
		- the `supplier` and `series` fields are set to example values; you'll need to replace them with the details of supplier and series registered as per the previous sections. The series must be registered in the Supplier Portal and follow Portuguese naming conventions (see [Series Management](/guides/pt-at#series-management) for details),
		- this is a `receipt` payment with the method set to `cash`, which causes GOBL to automatically assign the [`pt-saft-payment-means`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#payment-means) extension to `NU` (Numerário),
		- when running `gobl build`, the system automatically assigns the [`pt-saft-payment-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#payment-type) extension to `RG` and the [`pt-saft-source`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#document-source) extension to `P`,
		- the built version (`payment.mdx`) shows the normalized document with all automatically generated fields and extensions properly set,
		- the payment lines reference the original invoice document being paid, and,
		- there are no calculations in the minimal version; all normalizations will be made automatically when uploading.
