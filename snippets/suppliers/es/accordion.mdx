  <Accordion title="Spanish company">

    To register a company supplier in Spain you must provide:

    - **Company information**: name, NIF (tax identification number), and address
    - **Legal representative information**: full name, government ID type and number (DNI, NIE, or passport), and address

    The legal representative is the person authorized to sign the representation agreement on behalf of the company.

  <Accordion title="Spanish autónomo">
    An _autónomo_ is self-employed individuals in Spain who operate as sole proprietors. To register them, a NIF (tax id number) with the corresponding full name and address must be provided.

    Unlike company suppliers, autónomos do not require separate legal representative information since the individual is the authorized signatory.
