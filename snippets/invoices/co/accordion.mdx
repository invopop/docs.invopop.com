	<Accordion title="Example B2C invoice">

		In this example, we're issuing a B2C simplified invoice from a Colombian supplier to a consumer.

		Notice:

		- we've set the `simplified` tag in the `tax.tags` field; this indicates the invoice is for a final consumer,
		- the customer information is omitted, as it's not required for B2C transactions,
		- the invoice includes a prepayment advance of 100%, meaning the invoice has been fully paid,
		- the totals section shows the `advance` and `due` amounts, with the latter being zero since the invoice is fully paid, and,
		- there are no calculations in some fields; these will be made automatically when uploading.
