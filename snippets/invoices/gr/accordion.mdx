	<Accordion title="Example service invoice (B2B)">

		In this example, we're issuing a simple services invoice from a Greek supplier to another Greek business customer.

		Notice:

		- we've added the [`gr-mydata-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1) addon; this ensures the document will be validated and normalized using the myDATA v1 rules built into the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) library,
		- we've set the `services` tag; this makes the addon set the [`gr-mydata-invoice-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#invoice-type) extension automatically to `2.1` (service invoice),
		- similarly, the `credit-transfer` payment method will cause the addon to set the [`gr-mydata-payment-means`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#payment-means) extension to `1` (credit transfer),
		- we added a charge for a special fee (tourist accomodation fee), using the [`gr-mydata-fee`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#fee-category) extension,
		- the specific income category and type are set using the [`gr-mydata-income-cat`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#income-classification-category) extension and the [`gr-mydata-income-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#income-classification-type) extension respectively,
		- only [VAT rates](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/el#vat-rates) (`standard`) have been specified; percentages and values for the [`gr-mydata-vat-rate`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#vat-rate) extension will be set automatically, and,
		- there are no totals or calculations; all these will be made automatically when uploading.

	<Accordion title="Example retail sales receipt (B2C)">		
		In this example, we're issuing a simple goods invoice from a Greek supplier to a Greek final consumer.

		Notice:

		- we've set the `goods` and the `simplified` tags; this makes the addon set the [`gr-mydata-invoice-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#invoice-type) extension automatically to `11.1` (retail sales receipt),
		- similarly, the `cash` payment method will cause the addon to set the [`gr-mydata-payment-means`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#payment-means) extension to `3` (cash),
		- the specific income category and type are set using the [`gr-mydata-income-cat`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#income-classification-category) extension and the [`gr-mydata-income-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#income-classification-type) extension respectively,
		- only [VAT rates](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/el#vat-rates) (`standard`) or keys (`exempt`) have been specified; percentages and values for the [`gr-mydata-vat-rate`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#vat-rate) extension will be set automatically

	<Accordion title="Example climate fee invoice (B2B)">
		In this example, we're issuing a climate fee invoice from a Greek supplier to another Greek business customer. This is an example of how special records and other document types can be used in Greece.

		Notice:

		- we've set the `other` type and the `8.2` invoice type (climate crisis fee collection) explicitly using the [`gr-mydata-invoice-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#invoice-type) extension,
		- the climate fee is set as a charge using the [`gr-mydata-other-tax`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#other-tax) extension set to `8` (climate crisis fee),
		- there are no lines as this special record type doesn't allow them,
		- the `credit-transfer` payment method will cause the addon to set the [`gr-mydata-payment-means`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/gr-mydata-v1#payment-means) extension to `1` (credit transfer), and,
		- there are no totals or calculations; all these will be made automatically when uploading.
