	<Accordion title="Factur-X B2B Invoice">

		In this example, we're issuing a Factur-X B2B invoice from a French supplier to another French business customer. Factur-X is the French implementation of the same standard as ZUGFeRD, combining a PDF invoice with embedded XML data.

		Notice:

		- the minimal version (`facturx-b2b.min.mdx`) contains only the essential fields required to create the invoice,
		- the [`de-zugferd-v2`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/de-zugferd-v2) addon is used (as Factur-X and ZUGFeRD share the same technical specification),
		- both supplier and customer have their SIRET and TVA (VAT) numbers properly specified,
		- there are no totals or calculations in the minimal version; all these will be calculated automatically when running `gobl build`,
		- the built version (`facturx-b2b.mdx`) shows the normalized document with calculated totals, line item sums, TVA breakdowns, and automatically generated fields,
		- the invoice will generate both a human-readable PDF and embedded XML following the UN/CEFACT CII standard, and,
		- Factur-X is mandatory for B2G transactions in France and widely adopted for B2B transactions.
