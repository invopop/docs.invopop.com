		In this example, we're issuing a Chorus Pro invoice for business-to-government transactions in France. Chorus Pro is the mandatory platform for submitting invoices to French public sector entities.

		Notice:

		- the minimal version (`chorus-pro-b2g.min.mdx`) contains only the essential fields required to create the B2G invoice,
		- the [`fr-chorus-pro-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/fr-chorus-pro-v1) addon ensures the document will be validated using the Chorus Pro rules built into the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) library,
		- the customer must be a French public sector entity with a valid SIRET number,
		- specific Chorus Pro extensions and identifiers are required for public procurement (such as service codes and commitment numbers),
		- there are no totals or calculations in the minimal version; all these will be calculated automatically when running `gobl build`,
		- the built version (`chorus-pro-b2g.mdx`) shows the normalized document with calculated totals, line item sums, TVA breakdowns, and automatically generated fields,
		- the invoice will be formatted according to Chorus Pro requirements and submitted through the platform, and,
		- all invoices to French public entities above €25,000 must be submitted through Chorus Pro.
