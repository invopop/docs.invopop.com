  <Accordion title="B2B Standard invoice Belgium">
    Regular invoices are used for B2B transactions. Regular invoices must be issued when:

    - The customer is a registered business (has a tax identification number).
    - The transaction amount is €400 VAT included or above, or the customer requires a full invoice.
    - The customer needs a complete invoice with all tax details for accounting or tax purposes.

    To create a regular invoice, include the [`eu-en16931-v2017`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/eu-en16931-v2017) addon and ensure the `customer` field contains valid tax identification details. The addon will automatically set the document type to `380` when the silo entry is built (which happens automatically when saving a silo entry through the API or console).

    <Note>
      The `supplier` must be [previously registered](https://docs.invopop.com/guides/es-verifactu-supplier#create-a-supplier-entry) with the tax authority and the `customer` VAT ID must be valid.

  <Accordion title="B2B zero rated goods invoice Belgium">
    Goods and services that are subject to VAT but taxed at a 0% rate. Zero rated goods in Belgium are:

    - Daily and weekly newspapers, as well as periodical publications that meet a specific criteria.
    - Recyclable materials such as waste and scrap intended for recycling.
    - Educational materials under specific conditions.

    To create a reverse charge invoice, use the tax key `zero` in your invoice lines. The [`eu-en16931-v2017`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/eu-en16931-v2017) addon will automatically set the UNTDID 5305 tax category to `Z` (zero rated goods) when the silo entry is built.

    <Note>
      With zero-rated supplies, businesses can still reclaim input VAT on their purchases, whereas with exempt supplies they cannot.

  <Accordion title="B2B exempt invoice Belgium">
    Exempt invoices are used for B2B transactions that are exempt from VAT, which also covers exemptions in internal operations.

    To create an exempt invoice, use the tax key `exempt` in your invoice lines. The [`eu-en16931-v2017`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/eu-en16931-v2017) addon will automatically set the UNTDID 5305 tax category to `E` when the silo entry is built. You must also state the reason for the exemption through the [CET VATEX](https://docs.gobl.org/catalogues/cef#cef-vatex) - VAT exemption reason codes.

    <Note>
      Exempt operations are not subject to VAT but must still be reported. The `supplier` must be previously registered with the tax authority and the `customer` tax id must be valid.

  <Accordion title="B2B services invoice Belgium → EU customer (Reverse Charge)">
    Reverse charge invoices are used for B2B services provided to customers in other EU member states. Reverse charge must be applied when:

    - The customer is a registered business in another EU member state (has a valid EU VAT ID).
    - The service is provided to a business customer (B2B), not a consumer.
    - The service is subject to VAT but the customer accounts for the VAT in their own country.

    To create a reverse charge invoice, use the tax key `reverse-charge` in your invoice lines. The [`eu-en16931-v2017`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/eu-en16931-v2017) addon will automatically set the UNTDID 5305 tax category to `AE` (reverse charge) when the silo entry is built.

    <Note>
      With reverse charge, no VAT is charged by the supplier. The customer accounts for VAT in their own country. Both `supplier` and `customer` VAT ID must be valid and registered in the EU VIES system.

    - Goods are physically delivered to another EU member state.
    - The supply is exempt from VAT in the origin country and subject to VAT in the destination country.

    To create an intra-community supply Peppol invoice, use the tax key `intra-community` in your invoice lines. The [`eu-en16931-v2017`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/eu-en16931-v2017) addon will automatically set the UNTDID 5305 tax category to `K` (VAT exempt for EEA intra-community supply of goods and services) when the silo entry is built.

    <Note>
      With intra-community supplies in the EU, the customer accounts for VAT in their destination country. The `supplier` must be [previously registered](https://docs.invopop.com/guides/es-verifactu-supplier#create-a-supplier-entry) with the tax authority and the `customer` VAT ID must be valid and registered in the EU VIES system.
