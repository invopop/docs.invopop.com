	<Accordion title="AT delivery note">

		In this example, we're issuing a delivery note from a Portuguese supplier to another Portuguese receiver.

		Notice:

		- the minimal version (`delivery.min.mdx`) contains only the essential fields required to create the delivery document,
		- the [`pt-saft-v1`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1) addon ensures the document will be validated and normalized using the SAF-T PT v1 rules built into the [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) library,
		- the `supplier` and `series` fields are set to example values; you'll need to replace them with the details of supplier and series registered as per the previous sections. The series must be registered in the Supplier Portal and follow Portuguese naming conventions (see [Series Management](/guides/pt-at#series-management) for details),
		- this is an `advice` document type with the [`pt-saft-movement-type`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#movement-type) extension set to `GR` (Guia de Remessa),
		- when running `gobl build`, the system automatically calculates totals, applies the standard VAT rate with the [`pt-saft-tax-rate`](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/pt-saft-v1#tax-rate-code) extension set to `NOR`, and normalizes all fields,
		- the built version (`delivery.mdx`) shows the normalized document with calculated totals, line item sums, tax breakdowns, and automatically generated fields,
		- the [`pt-region`](https://docs.gobl.org/regimes/pt#region-code) extension is automatically set to `PT`, and,
		- there are no totals or calculations in the minimal version; all these will be made automatically when uploading.
