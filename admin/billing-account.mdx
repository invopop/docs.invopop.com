Billing accounts are used to associate workspaces with a specific payment method and tax information. Most companies will need to create a single billing account for all their workspaces, but if you need to use different payment methods or tax information for different workspaces, you can create multiple billing accounts.

## Billing accounts list

All accounts start with a free sandbox billing account. This gives access to sandbox functionality and allows you to keep track of the pops usage of your sandbox workspaces.

In order to have live workspaces, you need to create a live billing account. This will give access to live functionality and allow you to issue real invoices.

## Create a billing account

To create a billing account, click on the <kbd>Create billing account</kbd> button in the top right corner of the billing page. You will be prompted to name the account. We recommend naming the account after your company or organization + "billing" or "account".
