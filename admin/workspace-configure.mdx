Your account is created with a Sandbox workspace that you can use for testing and development. Create additional workspaces to organize your operations by regime, country, or business unit.

You create new workspaces in the **Workspaces** section of admin. Click the <kbd>Create workspace</kbd> button in the top right corner.

<Tip>
We recommend creating one workspace per regime or network. There is no limit on the number of workspaces you can create. See [Set up your account for multiple countries](/workspace/multi-country) for guidance on organizing workspaces.
</Tip>

#### Workspace name

Enter a human-readable name for your workspace. This is often your company name or a descriptive label that identifies the workspace's purpose e.g., `Enormicom ES-Live` or `Enormicom FR-Sandbox`.

#### Handle

The handle determines the URL of your workspace and is used in API endpoints. It's auto-generated from your workspace name, but you can customize it to your liking. Handles must be unique within Invopop and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

#### Avatar flag

Avatar flags are visual indicators that help you distinguish workspaces belonging to specific regimes or countries. They appear in the workspace selector and don't affect workspace behavior. Use flags to quickly identify workspaces when managing multiple countries or regions.

#### Workspace color

Choose a color that changes the appearance of buttons and the sidebar in your workspace. Use different colors between sandbox and production environments to easily distinguish which environment you're working in.

#### Workspace type

Select either **Sandbox** or **Live**:

- **Sandbox**: Test and simulate behavior without issuing real invoices. No billing account required.
- **Live**: Issue legally compliant invoices through tax authorities. Requires a billing account.

<Warning>
Live workspaces issue real, legally binding invoices. Ensure you've tested your workflows in a sandbox workspace before going live.
</Warning>

#### Billing account (Live workspaces only)

Select the billing account to associate with this workspace. Multi-country organizations often need to pay for invoicing locally, so you can have multiple billing accounts and assign different workspaces to different accounts.

<Tip>
If you haven't created a billing account yet, see [Add a billing account](/admin/billing-account) for instructions.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I delete workspaces?">
No, workspaces cannot be deleted for traceability and compliance purposes. If you no longer need a workspace, you can archive it or simply stop using it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change a workspace from Sandbox to Live?">
No, workspace type cannot be changed after creation. Create a new live workspace and migrate your workflows, apps, and configurations. See [From sandbox to live](/workspace/sandbox-to-live) for a complete guide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many workspaces can I create?">
There is no limit on the number of workspaces you can create. Create as many as you need to organize your operations effectively.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change the workspace handle after creation?">
You can change your handle (and thus the URL of your workspace) after creation. However, proceed with caution as this will break any links to your workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need a separate billing account for each workspace?">
No, you can assign multiple workspaces to the same billing account. However, multi-country organizations often use separate billing accounts for different regions to handle local payment requirements.
