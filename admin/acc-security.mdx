**Devices** will display the devices you have logged in from. The number is the IP address of the device, underneath the IP you will see the browser name, version and operating system.

**App** will usually display "Invopop Console" as the app name, however other products by Invopop which require authentication can be displayed here.

**Initiated** will display the date and time of the session.

**Disconnect** button allows you to revoke the session. If the same device is used to access Invopop Console again, you will be prompted to re-authenticate.
