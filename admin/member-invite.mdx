Members of your organization are users who can access your workspaces and workflows. Invite team members to collaborate on invoicing, workflow management, and document processing. There is no limit on the number of members you can invite to your organization.

<Note>
At the moment, we don't support role-based access control. All members have the same permissions, and every member in your organization will have access to all your workspaces. We're planning to implement workspace-level access control in Q2, 2026.

The invited member receives an email with a link to join your organization. When they accept the invitation:

- They gain access to all workspaces associated with your organization
- They can view and manage workflows, documents, and settings
- They appear in your members list with their email address and position

<Warning>
All members have full access to all workspaces in your organization. Only invite people you trust with access to your invoicing and document management systems.
