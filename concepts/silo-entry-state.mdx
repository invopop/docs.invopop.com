The service we use to store GOBL documents is called **Silo**. Each document uploaded to this service becomes part of a **Silo Entry**.

A silo entry is a JSON object defined by its own schema. It includes metadata fields, such as `id`, `state`, and `created_at`, and a `data` field that contains the actual GOBL document, which is itself defined by a separate [JSON schema](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/envelope).

You can find a full breakdown of the silo entry schema in the Invopop API Reference under [Fetch an entry](/api-ref/silo/entries/fetch-an-entry).

We refer to the `state` field as the **Silo Entry State**. Invopop provides a predefined set of values for this field to help standardize usage across workflows. These values reflect the current stage of a document within your workflow.

The available values include:
	1.	`Draft`: Document created but not yet in a workflow.
	2.	`Processing`: Document is being prepared or transformed.
	3.	`Registered`: Document marked as registered in your system.
	4.	`Sent`: Document marked as sent in your system.
	5.	`Paid`: Document marked as paid by your system.
	6.	`Error`: A processing or submission step failed.
	7.	`Void`: Document canceled or invalidated.

Silo entry states are user-defined and used for internal tracking only. They do not represent confirmations of external events such as successful registration with a tax authority or delivery to an endpoint.

For example, when the silo entry state is set to `Sent`, it could be used to imply the document has been flagged as submitted within your workflow, but it does not confirm that the tax agency has received or validated it.

<Tip>
	Think of silo entry states as workflow markers. They are a way for your system and team to track a document's progress in your workflow.
</Tip>

Invopop provides workflow templates that include recommended points where the silo entry state may be updated, but these are just guidelines. You're free to modify or override them as needed, as these values have no impact on actual document processing, delivery, or government validation.
