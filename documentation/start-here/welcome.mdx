invopop helps you issue, receive, and process business documents—such as invoices and receipts—in compliance with local tax regulations across our [supported countries](https://www.invopop.com/coverage).

## What is Invopop?

Think of Invopop as a translation engine for business documents. Our API accepts invoices in a single, universal format and converts them into the local format, forwarding them to the customer and tax authorities as needed. We also support receiving incoming invoices from local networks or providers, converting them to the same universal format.

Invopop doesn't just handle invoices—we support payment receipts, purchase orders, delivery notes, and more. All documents use [GOBL (Go Business Language)](https://gobl.org/), our open-source universal format. This means you only need to integrate once with Invopop-we manage the complexity of localization.

## How Invopop works

Every action in Invopop occurs in a [workflow](/guides/features/workflows), a predefined sequences of steps executed on a document-


A typical interaction involves uploading a document to the [API](https://docs.invopop.com/api-ref/introduction) and sending it to a workflow. The workflow then runs each step you've configured, such as converting the document to the local format, forwarding it to the tax authority, or storing it in Google Drive.

In addition to the API, you can use [Console](https://console.invopop.com)—our visual interface—to configure your account, view documents, and manage workflows.
