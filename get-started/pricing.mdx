The core of our pricing is based on **Pops**, our unit of computing usage. When selecting a plan, you are entitled to the specified number of Pops which will be spent on storage and actions performed on the document. If you are coming from an ERP or merchant platform can also add **integrations** which are extra to your computing credits.

To provide clarity on how your usage translates into a plan, here is a detailed breakdown of the Pops Calculator and how your total monthly cost is determined.

## Understanding Pops (our computing credits)

Pops are calculated based on a combination of the monthly documents you process and the specific actions you perform on them. Your pop consumption starts with the number of documents you plan to process each month.

`Total Pops = (Docs Processed × Base Pop Cost) + (Document Actions × Action Pop Cost)`

* Core actions such as Send Email or Generate PDF cost 1 pop.
* Format conversions such as Facturae, X-Rechnung, UBL or CII also costs 1 pop.
* Each network or tax authority has a different price depending on complexity of operation and implementation: 
		* TicketBAI, VERI\*FACTU or Peppol cost 2 pops.
		* SDI, AT, KSeF cost 3 pops.
		* DIAN, MyDATA, SAT, NFSe cost 5 pops.

### 3. Optional Add-ons (Connectors)

In addition to your Pop-based plan cost, we offer optional, fixed-monthly-fee connectors for easy integration with popular platforms. These are billed separately from your base plan.

| Add-on | Monthly Cost | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chargebee** | **+€170/month** | Connector for Chargebee integration |
| **Netsuite** | **+€170/month** | Connector for Netsuite integration |
| **Stripe** | **+€85/month** | Connector for Stripe integration |

## Example Cost Breakdown (Dev Plan)

Using the calculator, a user processing **300 documents/month** (which translates to 300 Pops, assuming 1 action per document) would fit within our Dev plan with an increased Pop capacity:

| Component | Detail | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plan Used** | Dev plan (500 pops capacity) | €43 |
| **Total per month** | Dev plan cost | **€43/mo** |
| **Total per year** | Dev plan cost, billed annually | **€516/yr** (Saves 15%) |

This example shows the flexibility of the Dev plan, which can be tailored to provide up to **500 pops/month** for a higher capacity, billed at the effective monthly rate of **€43** with a yearly commitment.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="When will I be charged?">

Invopop charges for subscriptions in advance at the start of each billing cycle. When you first subscribe, you'll be charged immediately for the full period. For subsequent renewals, you'll be charged on your billing anniversary date for the next billing period.

**How do monthly renewals work?**

Your subscription renews on the same day each month. For example, if you subscribe on March 31st, your renewal in February would occur on the 28th (or 29th in leap years) to account for different month lengths.

**What happens if I upgrade my plan mid-cycle?**

Upgrades are applied immediately. You'll receive a new invoice that accounts for your new plan, with appropriate credits for what you've already paid in the current billing period. The new benefits take effect right away.

**What about downgrades?**

Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period. This means you'll continue to enjoy your current plan's benefits until the next renewal date, when the downgrade will be applied.

**Do Developer and Pro plans work the same way?**

Yes, both prepaid Developer and Pro plans are charged in advance at the start of each billing cycle. The main differences are in the level of support included and the volume of pops provided.
