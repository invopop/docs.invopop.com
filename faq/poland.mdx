## Suppliers

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Why did my supplier registration fail?">
    Common reasons for registration failures:

    - **Certificate and private key mismatch**: Ensure you uploaded both files from the same certificate generation
    - **Incorrect password**: Verify the password matches what you set during certificate generation
    - **Future start date**: Certificate start date must be today or in the past
    - **Wrong portal environment**: Demo certificates won't work with production, and vice versa
    - **File encoding issues**: For API uploads, ensure files are properly base64-encoded
    - **Expired certificate**: Check that the certificate is still valid
    - **Invalid NIP**: Verify the Polish Tax ID is correct and has access to KSeF

    <Note>
      Check the workflow error logs in the Invopop Console for detailed error messages that can help diagnose the specific issue.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't have a Polish NIP for testing. How can I get one?">
    **For sandbox testing**:
    - **Test mode**: Generate fake NIPs at [http://generatory.it/](http://generatory.it/). These work immediately with self-signed certificates.
    - **Demo mode**: You need a real NIP with access to the KSeF Demo Portal.

    **For special cases**: If you need demo credentials but don't have Polish presence, contact the [support team](mailto:support@invopop.com). We can facilitate test NIPs and tokens for our clients.
  </Accordion>

## Sending invoices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What types of invoices are supported in Invopop's KSeF integration?">
    Currently supported invoice types:
    - **Standard Invoices (FAT)**: Regular B2B invoices with FA(3) schema
    - **Credit Notes (KOR)**: Invoice corrections and adjustments

    All invoices must include the `pl-favat-v3` addon in GOBL to ensure FA(3) schema compliance.

    <Note>
      Additional invoice types can be supported based on customer requirements. Contact [support](mailto:support@invopop.com) if you need specific invoice types.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I send an invoice to a foreign recipient?">
    International (cross-border) invoices are handled just like domestic invoices in KSeF:

    - The invoice is created in GOBL with the foreign recipient's details
    - It's converted to FA(3) XML format and submitted to KSeF
    - KSeF validates and clears the invoice, assigning a unique KSeF ID
    - The invoice is registered in the KSeF system

    However, since foreign recipients cannot access KSeF, you must deliver the invoice through other channels (email, EDI, etc.). Include the KSeF QR code in the delivery for verification purposes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will B2C transactions need to be reported in KSeF?">
    No. B2C invoices in KSeF are optional. The mandatory requirement applies only to B2B transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add attachments to an invoice in KSeF?">
    Yes. The structured "Zalacznik" (attachment) is allowed for tax-relevant data on quantities and unit prices. This feature is primarily aimed at technical transactions in the energy sector, but any company can apply to use attachments.

    Requirements:
    - Each attachment is limited to 3 MB
    - Attachments must contain only tax-related data
    - Do not include non-tax materials (contracts, manuals, advertising)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Receiving invoices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I import received invoices from suppliers?">
    Invopop automatically imports received invoices through a polling service:

    1. **Configure polling interval** during party registration (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly)
    2. **Set up the sync workflow** to query KSeF for new invoices
    3. **Configure the import workflow** to convert FA(3) XML to GOBL format
    4. **Link the workflows** in the Poland app configuration

    The system automatically checks KSeF at your chosen interval and imports any new invoices to your configured folder.

    **For manual import**, use the API to trigger import jobs with specific KSeF numbers or date ranges. See the [Import Received Invoices](/guides/pl-ksef#import-received-invoices) section in the guide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import historical invoices or backfill missed invoices?">
    Yes. You can manually trigger a sync workflow to import invoices from a specific date range using the [Create a Job endpoint](/api-ref/silo/jobs/create-a-job).

    Pass the `from` and `to` date parameters to sync all invoices received within that period:

    ```json
    {
      "workflow_id": "YOUR_SYNC_WORKFLOW_ID",
      "entry_id": "YOUR_PARTY_ENTRY_ID",
      "args": {
        "from": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "to": "2026-01-31T23:59:59Z"
      }
    }
    ```

    This is useful for backfilling invoices after a polling outage or importing historical data before enabling automatic polling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if my automatic invoice import is working?">
    Check these indicators:

    1. **Polling configuration**: Verify the polling interval is set in your party registration workflow configuration
    2. **App configuration**: Confirm the Poland app has your sync workflow configured
    3. **Recent imports**: Check the "Invoices · Expenses" folder for newly imported invoices
    4. **Job logs**: Review job logs in the Console for sync and import workflow executions
    5. **Error notifications**: Set up email or Slack notifications in your workflow error handling to alert you of failures

    <Tip>
      Test the import by manually triggering the sync workflow with a date range that includes known received invoices.

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between test, demo, and production environments?">
    **Test mode** (sandbox only): Uses self-signed certificates generated automatically by Invopop. Perfect for quick testing without accessing the KSeF portal. Invoices are not sent to real KSeF servers.

    **Demo mode** (sandbox only): Connects to the official [KSeF Demo Portal](https://ap-demo.ksef.mf.gov.pl/web/). Requires manual certificate generation, simulating the full production flow in a safe test environment.

    **Production mode** (live workspace): Connects to the live [KSeF Portal](https://ksef.mf.gov.pl/). Requires valid company credentials and certificates. All invoices are submitted to the official KSeF system.

    <Tip>
      Use test mode for initial integration testing, then switch to demo mode when you're ready to simulate the real certificate flow before going live.
    </Tip>
