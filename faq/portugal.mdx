  <Accordion title="What is supplier registration information and when is it required?">
  Supplier registration information includes business details such as the commercial registry number, registration date, capital value, and the NIF used during registration. Portuguese law requires this information to appear on all printed fiscal documents, including PDFs.

  **When is it mandatory?**

  Registration information is mandatory for companies and legal entities. However, self-employed individuals and freelancers (whose NIF starts with 1, 2, or 3) are exempt from this requirement, as they typically do not have formal registration details.

  **Why is it required?**

  During the AT certification process, tax inspectors explicitly required that registration information could not be optional for applicable issuers. This ensures that all fiscal documents meet compliance standards and contain the legally required business information.

  **What about the "other" field?**

  The "other" field is optional and used to specify the NIF that was used during the company's registration. Older companies may have used a different NIF when they were registered than their current one. This field can be left blank if not applicable.

  <Accordion title="Should our customers upload their SAF-T files manually?">
  In Portugal, fiscally relevant documents issued through invoicing software must be reported to the Tax Authority (AT). There are two possible reporting models:

  1. **SAF-T monthly export** – a single XML file including all documents for the month. This file is generated by the invoicing software and then uploaded manually to the AT portal, as there is no API available for submitting it automatically.
  2. **Real-time transmission** – instead of a monthly file, each invoice is sent individually to the AT at the time of issuance, using the authority's API.

  Whether one model or the other is used usually depends on the issuers accountant's preference (who typically upload the SAF-T monthly report should they choose that model)
  If you're using our [InvoiceXpress solution](/apps/invoicexpress-portugal), then each supplier can configure SAF-T generation or real-time submission directly in the InvoiceXpress portal.
  If instead you're using [our own certified solution](/apps/at-portugal), at this moment we support SAF-T generation. We will also enable real-time AT reporting as an alternative in Q4, 2025.
