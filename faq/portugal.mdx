  <Accordion title="Should our customers upload their SAF-T files manually?">
  In Portugal, fiscally relevant documents issued through invoicing software must be reported to the Tax Authority (AT). There are two possible reporting models:

  1. **SAF-T monthly export** – a single XML file including all documents for the month. This file is generated by the invoicing software and then uploaded manually to the AT portal, as there is no API available for submitting it automatically.
  2. **Real-time transmission** – instead of a monthly file, each invoice is sent individually to the AT at the time of issuance, using the authority's API.

  Whether one model or the other is used usually depends on the issuers accountant's preference (who typically upload the SAF-T monthly report should they choose that model)
  If you're using our [InvoiceXpress solution](/apps/invoicexpress-portugal), then each supplier can configure SAF-T generation or real-time submission directly in the InvoiceXpress portal.
  If instead you're using [our own certified solution](/apps/at-portugal), at this moment we support SAF-T generation. We will also enable real-time AT reporting as an alternative in Q4, 2025.
