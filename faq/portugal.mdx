  <Accordion title="Should our customers upload their SAF-T files manually?">
  In Portugal, fiscally relevant documents issued through invoicing software must be reported to the Tax Authority (AT). There are two possible reporting models:

  1. **SAF-T monthly export** – a single XML file including all documents for the month. This file is generated by the invoicing software and then uploaded manually to the AT portal, as there is no API available for submitting it automatically.
  2. **Real-time transmission** – instead of a monthly file, each invoice is sent individually to the AT at the time of issuance, using the authority's API.

  Whether one model or the other is used usually depends on the issuers accountant's preference (who typically upload the SAF-T monthly report should they choose that model)
  If you're using our [InvoiceXpress solution](/apps/invoicexpress-portugal), then each supplier can configure SAF-T generation or real-time submission directly in the InvoiceXpress portal.
  If instead you're using [our own certified solution](/apps/at-portugal), at this moment we support SAF-T generation. We will also enable real-time AT reporting as an alternative in Q4, 2025.

  <Accordion title="What is supplier registration information in invoices and other documents?">
  Supplier registration information includes the company's share capital, the commercial registry office, and optionally the NIF used during registration. Portuguese law requires this information to appear on all printed fiscal documents, including PDFs.

  **When is it mandatory?**

  Registration information is mandatory for companies and legal entities. However, self-employed individuals and freelancers (whose NIF starts with 1, 2, or 3) are exempt from this requirement, as they typically do not have formal registration details.

  **What about the "other" field?**

  The `other` field is optional and can be used to specify the NIF of the company when it was registered if different from the current one.

  <Accordion title="Can I issue credit notes for invoices created in a different system?">
  Credit notes can only be issued for invoices that were originally created within our system. This limitation applies to both our direct AT integration and our integration via InvoiceXpress.

  Portuguese tax regulations require credit notes to maintain proper audit trails and reference links to their original invoices. When an invoice is created outside our system, we cannot establish the necessary fiscal references and compliance links that the Portuguese Tax Authority (AT) requires. This ensures that all credit notes meet regulatory requirements and maintain the integrity of your tax reporting. If you've migrated from another invoicing system, you'll need to issue credit notes through that original system.
