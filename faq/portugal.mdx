  <Accordion title="Should our customers upload their SAF-T files manually?">
  In Portugal, fiscally relevant documents issued through invoicing software must be reported to the Tax Authority (AT). There are two possible reporting models:

  1. **SAF-T monthly export** – a single XML file including all documents for the month. This file is generated by the invoicing software and then uploaded manually to the AT portal, as there is no API available for submitting it automatically.
  2. **Real-time transmission** – instead of a monthly file, each invoice is sent individually to the AT at the time of issuance, using the authority's API.

  Whether one model or the other is used usually depends on the issuers accountant's preference (who typically upload the SAF-T monthly report should they choose that model)
  If you're using our [InvoiceXpress solution](/apps/invoicexpress-portugal), then each supplier can configure SAF-T generation or real-time submission directly in the InvoiceXpress portal.
  If instead you're using [our own certified solution](/apps/at-portugal), at this moment we support SAF-T generation. We will also enable real-time AT reporting as an alternative in Q4, 2025.

  <Accordion title="What is supplier registration information in invoices and other documents?">
  Supplier registration information includes the company's share capital, the commercial registry office, and optionally the NIF used during registration. Portuguese law requires this information to appear on all printed fiscal documents, including PDFs.

  **When is it mandatory?**

  Registration information is mandatory for companies and legal entities. However, self-employed individuals and freelancers (whose NIF starts with 1, 2, or 3) are exempt from this requirement, as they typically do not have formal registration details.

  **What about the "other" field?**

  The `other` field is optional and can be used to specify the NIF of the company when it was registered if different from the current one.

<Accordion title="Error: 'An account for the provided tax ID code and name already exists…'">
When you run the supplier registration workflow for a new supplier, you may get the following KO error:

> An account for the provided tax ID code and name already exists under a different supplier UUID. The same tax code ID can be used with multiple suppliers as long as they have different names.

#### What does this mean?

InvoiceXpress allows you to register the same tax ID (_Número de Identificação Fiscal_) for multiple suppliers. This is useful if, for example, a single invoice issuer wants to segregate invoices by branch or location. In these cases, you can create multiple suppliers with the same tax ID but different names.

However, there is a limitation in InvoiceXpress: you must provide a unique name for each supplier when registering a new account with the same tax ID. If InvoiceXpress detects that both the tax ID and the name match an existing account, it assumes you want to use the existing account instead of creating a new one. To prevent confusion, our system checks for this scenario and displays the error above if it occurs.

**How to resolve this issue:**
- Make sure the `name` you provide for the new supplier is different from any existing supplier with the same tax ID in InvoiceXpress.
- The `supplier` UUID must also be unique for each supplier you register.
