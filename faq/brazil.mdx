  <Accordion title="What type of Documentos Fiscais does Invopop support?">
    Invopop supports NF-e, NFS-e and NFC-e documents. Transport documents (MDF-e and CF-e) are not currently supported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I change my integration for the 2026 NFS-e federal tax format regulation?">
    It is not necessary, any fields pertaining to the previous municipal tax implementation will be ignored and the invoice will already have all the data to be compliant. However, it is always recommended to remove ignored fields to avoid confusion and keep your documents clean.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issuing B2C invoices is mandatory in Brazil?">
    Yes, all transaction are mandatory in Brazil.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you support other types of documentos fiscais eletrônicos?">
    At the moment, only NFC-e and NFS-e are supported. We are working on adding support for other types.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where can I find the mapping of GOBL fields to DF-e documents?">
    For further details on how GOBL prepares data for conversion, see:

    - The [NFS-e Addon GOBL Reference](https://docs.gobl.org/addons/br-nfse-v1).

  <Accordion title="How does ISS tax work in Brazil?">
    ISS (Imposto Sobre Serviços) is not treated as a standard transactional tax calculated on top of a net amount. Instead, it is an **informative tax embedded in the final price**—the invoice only reports what portion of the total corresponds to ISS.

    Because of this special treatment:
    - ISS is not added to the price; it is already included in the final amount.
    - The NFS-e document displays ISS as informational data, not as a calculated tax line.
    - GOBL and Invopop handle ISS downstream, injecting the ISS information automatically into the document before submission to the Brazilian tax authority while ensuring pricing data remains compliant with NFS-e rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I configure Chargebee or Stripe imports for Brazilian invoices with ISS?">
    Since ISS is an informative tax embedded in the final price (not a standard tax added on top), you should **not configure ISS as a tax** in Chargebee or Stripe.

    The correct setup is:
    - **No ISS tax configured** in your billing platform (Chargebee, Stripe, etc.).
    - Prices in your billing platform should already be the **final public prices** with ISS embedded.
    - ISS information is handled downstream by Invopop, purely as informational data on the NFS-e.

    If ISS is included in the billing platform payload, Invopop attempts to interpret it as a regular price-inclusive tax, which leads to `invalid-prices-include` errors during import. This pricing model is not compatible with how ISS works for NFS-e.

    Your Invopop import workflow automatically injects the ISS information into the document after import and before submission to the Brazilian tax authority.
