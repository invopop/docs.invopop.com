  <Accordion title="What type of Documentos Fiscais does Invopop support?">
    Invopop supports NF-e, NFS-e and NFC-e documents. Transport documents (MDF-e and CF-e) are not currently supported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I change my integration for the 2026 NFS-e federal tax format regulation?">
    It is not necessary, any fields pertaining to the previous municipal tax implementation will be ignored and the invoice will already have all the data to be compliant. However, it is always recommended to remove ignored fields to avoid confusion and keep your documents clean.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issuing B2C invoices is mandatory in Brazil?">
    Yes, all transaction are mandatory in Brazil.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you support other types of documentos fiscais eletrônicos?">
    At the moment, only NFC-e and NFS-e are supported. We are working on adding support for other types.

  <Accordion title="How is ISS tax handled differently from other taxes?">
    In Brazil, ISS (Imposto Sobre Serviços) is not treated as a standard transactional tax calculated on top of a net amount. Instead, it is an **informative tax embedded in the final price**, where the invoice only reports what portion of the total corresponds to ISS.

    Key characteristics of ISS:
    - **Not calculated**: ISS is not added to or calculated from the base price.
    - **Already included**: The final price already contains the ISS amount.
    - **Informative only**: The invoice simply indicates how much of the total price represents ISS.
    - **NFS-e specific**: This treatment is specific to service invoices (NFS-e) in Brazil.

    Because of this special treatment, ISS should be handled differently from regular taxes when integrating with billing systems like Chargebee or Stripe. The ISS information is injected by Invopop downstream after import and before submission to the Brazilian tax authority, ensuring pricing data remains compliant with NFS-e rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How should I configure Chargebee or Stripe to handle ISS tax correctly?">
    When using Chargebee or Stripe with Invopop for Brazilian invoices, follow these guidelines to properly handle ISS tax:

    ### Important: Do NOT configure ISS as a tax in Chargebee or Stripe

    Since ISS is an informative tax embedded in the final price (not a transactional tax), it should **not** be configured as a tax in your billing system. If you configure ISS as a tax in Chargebee or Stripe, Invopop will attempt to interpret it as a regular price-inclusive tax, leading to `invalid-prices-include` errors during the import step.

    ### Correct Configuration

    **For Chargebee:**
    - Do not add ISS as a tax in Chargebee's tax configuration.
    - Set your prices to the final public prices (with ISS already embedded).
    - Invopop will automatically inject ISS information into the document after import and before submission to the Brazilian tax authority.

    **For Stripe:**
    - Do not configure ISS as a tax item in Stripe.
    - Your prices should already be the final amounts (ISS embedded).
    - The ISS data will be handled downstream by Invopop as informational data on the NFS-e.

    ### How it works

    Invopop's import workflow automatically:
    1. Imports the invoice from Chargebee or Stripe with the final prices.
    2. Injects the appropriate ISS information into the GOBL document.
    3. Ensures the pricing data remains compliant with NFS-e rules.
    4. Submits the properly formatted document to the Brazilian tax authority.

    This approach ensures that your invoices are correctly formatted for NFS-e compliance without causing pricing conflicts or import errors.
