## General

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How are credit notes and corrections handled?">
  E-invoices cannot be deleted or retracted. Instead a credit note or corrected invoice can be sent referencing the original invoice. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I view an XML attached to a PDF?">
    In Factur-X PDFs, the XML file is embedded within the PDF itself. To extract and view it, you can use the `Attachments` section in Adobe Acrobat Reader.

    Alternatively, you can use specialized tools like the [SysTools PDF Extractor](https://www.systoolsgroup.com/pdf/extractor/) to extract the XML file.

## E-reporting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to e-report imports?">
    If the supply is taxable under French reverse charge (i.e. VAT is paid on import), the transaction must be e-reported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When should I e-report payment data?">
    Report payment data only when VAT is due on receipt of payment, such as for services under "cash VAT" (TVA sur les encaissements).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does this apply to foreign businesses without a Fixed Establishment (FE) in France?">
    E-invoicing does not apply. If the business is liable to French VAT, e-reporting applies to the relevant flows. E-reporting for reverse-charge VAT and intra EU-acquisitions are deferred till 1 September 2027.
  </Accordion>
