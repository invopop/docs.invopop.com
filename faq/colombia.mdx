  <Accordion title="My [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) document for a Colombian invoice fails to build because of the postal code">
    The DIAN requires a [Municipal Code](https://www.dian.gov.co/atencionciudadano/formulariosinstructivos/Formularios/2007/Codigos_municipios_2007.pdf) rather than a postal code to specify the municipality of the supplier. Make sure you are setting a municipal code (5 digits) and not a postal code (6 digits) within the supplier's address.
