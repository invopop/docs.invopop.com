  <Accordion title="Do invoices need to be sent to the tax authority?">
    In Belgium specifically there is no need to send a copy to the tax authority until the e-reporting mandate comes into effect in Jan 2028.

  <Accordion title="How do ensure my Peppol participant ID corresponds to BOSA?">
    In Belgium, all Peppol participants are already registered with BOSA, the Belgian Peppol Authority. This means that every Belgian company is automatically part of the Peppol network. To onboard these companies in Invopop, we first migrate their registration from BOSA to our system.
  </Accordion> 
  <Accordion title="What should we do if the customer doesn't belong to the Peppol network?">

				In countries like Belgium where Peppol is the standard but not mandatory, you must often provide an e-invoice even if the recipient isn't registered in the Peppol network. 

				According to the Belgian Tax Authority, both parties can agree on an alternative transfer method (not Peppol), but the invoice must still be EN16931 compliant.

				**Recommended approach:**
				- Set up a separate workflow that generates the XML without sending it via Peppol
				- Alternatively, use your current workflow without the customer Peppol ID (the send Peppol document step will automatically skip)
				- Fetch the generated XML
				- Deliver it through an agreed-upon method, typically email
