  <Accordion title="How do ensure my Peppol participant ID corresponds to BOSA?">
    In Belgium, all Peppol participants are already registered with BOSA, the Belgian Peppol Authority. This means that every Belgian company is automatically part of the Peppol network. To onboard these companies in Invopop, we first migrate their registration from BOSA to our system.
