  <Accordion title="How are Greek invoice types specified?">
    The Greek tax authority (IAPR) requires the invoice type to be specified as part of the invoice. In [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org), this type can be set using the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension in the tax section and setting the [GOBL invoice type](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) to other.

    Alternatively, GOBL will set the extension for you based on the type and the tax tags you set in your [GOBL invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice). You can read more in the [GOBL Greece Tax Regime readme](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/gr/README.md).

    If you produce a PDF version of the invoice, the invoice type label will be displayed instead of "Invoice".
