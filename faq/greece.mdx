  <Accordion title="How are Greek invoice types specified?">
    The Greek tax authority (IAPR) requires the invoice type to be specified as part of the invoice. In [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org), this type can be set using the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension in the tax section and setting the [GOBL invoice type](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) to other.

    Alternatively, GOBL will set the extension for you based on the type and the tax tags you set in your [GOBL invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice). You can read more in the [GOBL Greece Tax Regime readme](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/gr/README.md).

    If you produce a PDF version of the invoice, the invoice type label will be displayed instead of "Invoice".

  <Accordion title="Where can I find the mapping of GOBL fields to myDATA?">
    For further details on how GOBL prepares data for conversion, see the [Greek Tax Regime](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/gr/README.md).

  <Accordion title="What if my business already uses another myDATA provider?">
    Greek regulation does not allow two myDATA providers to operate simultaneously for the same VAT number. If your business currently uses a different provider, you will need to switch to Invopop's provider (ILYDA) before issuing invoices through the platform.

    The regulatory restriction applies to simultaneous use of multiple providers, not to changing from one to another. See the [supplier registration](/guides/gr-iapr#register-a-supplier) section in our Greece guide for details on the onboarding process, or contact us via Slack or [support@invopop.com](mailto:support@invopop.com).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my credit note being rejected with 'Invoice not found' error?">
    If you issue a credit note shortly after the invoice it refers to, the MyDATA system may reject it because the original invoice hasn't completed synchronization. You'll typically see an error like:

    ```
    Fatal error 301: Invoice with ΜΑΡΚ xxxx not found for VAT number xxxx
    ```

    This happens because there can be a delay between when an invoice is accepted by MyDATA and when it becomes fully available for reference by other documents like credit notes. This delay can range from a few minutes to several hours, depending on MyDATA system load.

    **Solution**: If you receive this error, retry issuing the credit note after waiting some time. You may need to wait anywhere from a few minutes to several hours for the original invoice to be fully synchronized in the MyDATA system before the credit note can successfully reference it.
