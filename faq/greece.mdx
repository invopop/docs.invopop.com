  <Accordion title="How are Greek invoice types specified?">
    The Greek tax authority (IAPR) requires the invoice type to be specified as part of the invoice. In [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org), this type can be set using the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension in the tax section and setting the [GOBL invoice type](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) to other.

    Alternatively, GOBL will set the extension for you based on the type and the tax tags you set in your [GOBL invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice). You can read more in the [GOBL Greece Tax Regime readme](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/gr/README.md).

    If you produce a PDF version of the invoice, the invoice type label will be displayed instead of "Invoice".

  <Accordion title="Where can I find the mapping of GOBL fields to myDATA?">
    For further details on how GOBL prepares data for conversion, see the [Greek Tax Regime](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/gr/README.md).

  <Accordion title="Why is my credit note being rejected with 'Invoice not found' error?">
    If you issue a credit note shortly after the invoice it refers to, the MyDATA system may reject it because the original invoice hasn't completed synchronization. You'll typically see an error like:

    ```
    Fatal error 301: Invoice with ΜΑΡΚ xxxx not found for VAT number xxxx
    ```

    This happens because there can be a delay between when an invoice is accepted by MyDATA and when it becomes fully available for reference by other documents like credit notes. This delay can range from a few minutes to several hours, depending on MyDATA system load.

    **Solution**: If you receive this error, retry issuing the credit note after waiting some time. You may need to wait anywhere from a few minutes to several hours for the original invoice to be fully synchronized in the MyDATA system before the credit note can successfully reference it.
