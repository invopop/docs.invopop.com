  <Accordion title="Am I required to issue B2B or B2C e-invoices in Denmark?">
    No. As of 2026, Denmark has **no B2B or B2C e-invoicing transmission mandate**. The [Digital Bookkeeping Act](/compliance/denmark#digital-bookkeeping-act-b2b) requires businesses to use certified systems that are *capable* of sending and receiving structured e-invoices (PEPPOL BIS 3.0 and OIOUBL), but it does not require that every invoice is actually sent electronically. You must be ready to e-invoice, but you are not yet obligated to do so for B2B or B2C transactions.

    E-invoicing is only mandatory for **B2G** — all invoices to Danish public authorities must be submitted electronically via NemHandel or the PEPPOL network. A domestic e-reporting obligation covering B2B is expected by approximately 2028.
