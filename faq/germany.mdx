  <Accordion title="Is there a legal mandate to use Peppol?">
    There is no legal mandate to use Peppol in Germany. The requirement is to issue and receive invoices in a structured, EN 16931-compliant format (like XRechnung or ZUGFeRD).

    In practice, Peppol is by far the most widely used network, because it is the standardized, government‑endorsed way to exchange XRechnung invoices electronically with German public authorities and, increasingly, with large businesses. Using Peppol ensures:

      * Interoperability with virtually all public sector recipients.
      * Compliance with format and technical rules without having to negotiate separate connections or portals.
      * Access via certified Peppol Access Points, which handle validation and delivery.
      * Other delivery channels exist (email, portal upload), but they are often less convenient, less standardized, and may not scale for high-volume or cross-border invoicing. So, while Peppol isn't legally required, almost everyone uses it in practice for compliance and efficiency.

  <Accordion title="Are there any issuing timing requirements in Germany?">
    Timing is linked to contractual and procedural deadlines, not a specific law that defines a universal submission window. However, in the context of B2G many authorities specify invoice submission within 10 days of service completion in their contracts or portals, so it's best to issue the invoice as early as possible.

    In the case of B2B the general VAT rule states that the invoice must be issued within 15 days after the end of the month in which the supply was made, if the transaction is subject to VAT and involves another taxable business. This 15-day window is critical because late issuance can make VAT reporting inconsistent between supplier and customer and it may also affect the buyer's right to input VAT deduction.

  <Accordion title="Which XRechnung syntax should I choose, UBL or CII?">
    Both syntaxes are equally valid and contain the same information, so in the majority of cases the choice has no consequences.

    If you plan on sending invoices through the PEPPOL network, we recommend using UBL as it is the supported format. If you plan on also issuing invoices in ZUGFeRD or Factur-X, it might be more convenient to use CII, as it is the syntax also supported by ZUGFeRD and Factur-X.

  <Accordion title="How can I view an XML attached to a PDF?">
    For ZUGFeRD PDFs, the XML file is embedded within the PDF itself. To extract and view it, you can use the `Attachments` section in Adobe Acrobat Reader.

    Alternatively, you can use specialized tools like the [SysTools PDF Extractor](https://www.systoolsgroup.com/pdf/extractor/) to extract the XML file.
