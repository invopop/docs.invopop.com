  <Accordion title="Do I have to issue B2C invoices in Mexico">
    Purchases under $100 mxn don't need to be issued, but they need to be registered in the global CFDI. Often issuing all invoices will simplify your operation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does invopop support the white label (B2B2B) model in Mexico?">
    Yes. We must obtain a the supplier's CSD (digtial seal) and credentials to issue invoices in that company's name. We are especially powerful and simple for this. Read more in our [white label use case](/guides/white-label).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does it mean that Mexico has a clearance model for invoicing?">
    A clearance model (sometimes called real-time validation or pre-clearance) is a regulatory architecture in which each invoice must be electronically submitted to the tax authority and formally approved before it becomes legally valid. The government acts as an intermediary between the supplier and the buyer and the invoice will only be valid with state authorization. Only after authorization you can dispatch goods, book revenue or send an invoice to the customer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación) does Invopop use?">
    Invopop uses [SW Sapien](https://sw.com.mx), an Authorised Certification Provider (PAC), to sign and stamp CFDI documents for the Mexican tax authority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where can I find the mapping of GOBL fields to CFDI?">
    The library that transforms GOBL into CFDI documents is publicly available as an open-source project and can be found at [github.com/invopop/gobl.cfdi](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.cfdi).

    For further details on how GOBL prepares data for conversion, see the [Mexico Tax Regime](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/mx/README.md).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I issue invoices with the 8% tax rate in border zones?">
    In Mexico, a reduced VAT rate of 8% applies to transactions in border zones (northern and southern border regions). To successfully issue invoices with this rate, **both** of the following conditions must be met:

    1. The supplier's RFC must be enabled by the SAT to invoice with the reduced rate in border zones.
    2. Both the `mx-cfdi-issue-place` field and the customer's postal code (when included) must correspond to border zones.

    If either condition is not met, the SAT will reject the invoice with an error.
