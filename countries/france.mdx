## E-invoicing in France

France's e-invoicing reform aims to modernize tax collection, combat VAT fraud, and align with EU digitalization initiatives through a phased implementation approach.

France runs on the Peppol network. Businesses connect through a certified **Plateforme AgrÃ©Ã©e** (PA). For each invoice, the PA looks up the buyer in the state **Annuaire** and routes the document to the buyer's PA over Peppol. In paralell, the PA submits the mandated e-invoice/e-report dataset to the government **data concentrator**, where the state stores the VAT data for each transaction.

<Note>B2C invoicing is not required in France under the new e-invoicing mandate.</Note>

## E-reporting

E-reporting lets the **DGFiP** receive VAT-relevant data for B2C and cross-border B2B/B2C sales on the cadence of each company's VAT regime. It aims to cut errors in returns, strengthen fraud detection and eventually enable prefilled VAT declarations. Mandatory from 1 September 2026 for large and intermediate enterprises; SMEs and micro-enterprises follow on 1 September 2027. 


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-Reporting">
Businesses submit aggregated transaction data via a PA in line with their VAT reporting regime cadence. The government stores the information in the data concentrator.
