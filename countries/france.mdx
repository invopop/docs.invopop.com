## E-invoicing in France

France's e-invoicing reform aims to modernize tax collection, combat VAT fraud, and align with EU digitalization initiatives through a phased implementation approach.

France uses the Peppol network. Businesses connect through a certified **Plateforme AgrÃ©Ã©e** (**PA**). For each invoice, the PA looks up the buyer in the state **Annuaire** and routes the document to the buyer's PA over Peppol. In paralell, the PA submits the mandated e-invoice/e-report dataset to the government **data concentrator**, where the state stores the VAT data for each transaction.

    B2G e-invoicing has been mandatory in France since 2020. All suppliers invoicing French public entities must submit electronic invoices through approved platforms.

      B2B e-invoicing will be rolled out in phases:

      - **2025**: Pilot phase
      - **September 2026**: All businesses must accept e-invoices; large and medium-sized companies must issue e-invoices
      - **September 2027**: All businesses must issue e-invoices

<Note>
  B2C invoicing is not required in France under the new e-invoicing mandate.
</Note>

## E-reporting

E-reporting sends invoicing data to the **DGFiP** when e-invoicing is not enforceable. Therefore B2C and B2B cross-border transactions must be e-reported.
It aims to cut errors in returns, strengthen fraud detection and eventually enable prefilled VAT declarations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-Reporting">
    Businesses submit aggregated transaction data through a certified PA. Submission follows the company's VAT filing schedule (for example, monthly or quarterly). The government stores the information in the data concentrator for VAT visibility.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to e-report imports?">
    If the supply is taxable under French reverse charge (i.e. VAT is paid on import), the transaction must be e-reported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I e-report payment data?">
    Report payment data only when VAT is due on receipt of payment, such as for services under "cash VAT" (TVA sur les encaissements).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does this apply to foreign businesses without a Fixed Establishment (FE) in France?">
    E-invoicing does not apply. If the business is liable to French VAT, e-reporting applies to the relevant flows. E-reporting for reverse-charge VAT and intra EU-acquisitions are deferred till 1 September 2027.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are credit notes and corrections handled?">
    E-invoices cannot be deleted or retracted. Instead a credit note or corrected invoice can be sent referencing the original invoice.
