## Executive summary

import { PeppolIcon } from '/snippets/icons/app-peppol.jsx';
import { ChorusproIcon } from '/snippets/icons/fr-choruspro.jsx';

In France, e-invoicing runs on hybrid public and private framework linking a central state hub with Approved Platforms (**AP**s), designed to ensure transparency, prevent fraud, and align with EU digitalization standards.

Compliance is structured around two key functions: **e-invoicing** and **e-reporting**. Approved Platforms issue, receive and report invoice data for businesses. **AP**s route each e-invoice through the French tax authority as it transmits the data to the receiving business. 

- [B2B e-invoicing](#b2b-e-invoicing) becomes mandatory in phases from 1 September 2026, depending on company size.
- [E-reporting](#e-reporting) is required for B2C and B2B cross-border transactions.
- [B2G e-invoicing](#b2g-e-invoicing) will continue through Chorus Pro.
- All businesses must **receive** B2B e-invoices by 1 September 2026.

## E-invoicing in France

 An e-invoice contains the same information included in a regular invoice, but it is issued, transmitted, and stored in a structured data format like XML. The new mandate centers on domestic B2B transactions, but the public sector has used e-invoices since 2020.  

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2G">
    B2G e-invoicing has been used in France since 2020. All suppliers invoicing French public entities must submit electronic invoices through approved platforms.

  <Accordion title="B2B (Business-to-Business)">
   All domestic B2B invoices must be e-invoices: structured XML files sent over the Peppol network. Businesses connect through a certified **Plateforme agréée** (**PA**), which validates the file, queries the state **Annuaire** to locate the buyer, and routes the invoice to the buyer's **PA** via Peppol.

In parallel, the **PA** submits the mandated e-invoice to the government **data concentrator**, where VAT data is stored for each transaction.

<Note>
  B2C and B2B cross-border transactions are e-reported
</Note>

## E-reporting

E-reporting sends invoicing data to the **DGFiP** whenever e-invoicing doesn't apply. Because B2C sales, cross-border B2B transactions and payment events fall outside the e-invoicing scope, the state uses e-reporting to track VAT flows and, ultimately, to enable prefilled VAT declarations. 
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-Reporting">
    E-reporting can be divided into two categories that must be reported: **transaction data** and **payment data**.

## Regulation

The **Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (DGFIP)** is the French public finance directorate responsible for tax collection and enforcement. It oversees the implementation of e-invoicing and e-reporting requirements in France.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-invoicing">
    E-invoicing only applies to domestic B2B transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue e-invoices">
    You're not required to issue e-invoices for the following transactions:
    - B2C transactions; 
    - International B2B transactions;
    - Foreign operators with no Fixed Establishment (**FE**) in France; and
    - Transactions located outside of France for VAT purposes.
    <Note>
      All businesses operating in France must be able to **receive** e-invoices from 1 September 2026.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="E-reporting">
    The following transactions are in scope.
    - B2C transactions 
    - Cross border B2B transactions (such as exports, intra-EU supplies, and acquisitions)
    - Companies without a Fixed Establishment (**FE**) supplying to French consumers that are liable to French VAT.
    - Payment collections for **services** under **cash VAT** (TVA sur les encaissements)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to send e-reports">
    The following flows are out of scope
    - Imports of goods
    - B2C transactions operating under **EU OSS/IOSS** (the European One Stop Shop agreement)  
    - Classified or national security contracts
    - VAT-exempt transactions
    - Reverse charges when the buyer is liable to VAT
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Businesses with no Fixed-Establishment (FE) in France">
    Non-established businesses operate in France without a SIREN or SIRET registration, the unique VAT ID given to each business. Without this 9 digit number, non-established businesses cannot receive or issue e-invoices through the French domestic network. 

Instead, they must e-report transactions and payments when they are liable for French VAT. They are required to report:
- B2B transactions subject to French VAT
- B2C transactions made in France
- Reverse-charge transactions when they remain partly VAT-liable
  <Note>
  Companies without a Fixed Establishment in France will transmit e-reporting data to the **DGFiP** via an Approved Platform.
  </Note>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="E-reporting cycles">
    Below is a list of **what** you report and **when** you send it. Timing depends on how VAT reporting schedule and the category of flow (transactions vs payments).
    
#### Standard VAT regime (régime réel normal mensuel)
- **Transaction data:** Reported **three times per month** (1–10, 11–20, and 21–end of month), within 10 days after each period.
- **Payment data:** Reported **monthly**, before the 10th of the following month.

#### Quarterly VAT regime (régime réel normal trimestriel)
- **Transaction data:** Reported monthly, before the 10th of the following month.
- **Payment data:** Also monthly, before the 10th of the following month.

#### Simplified VAT regime (régime simplifié d’imposition TVA)
- **Transaction data:** Reported monthly, between the 25th and 30th of the following month.
- **Payment data:** Also monthly, between the 25th and 30th of the following month.

#### VAT exemption regime (franchise en base de TVA)
- **Transaction data:** Reported every two months, between the 25th and 30th of each two-month period.
- **Payment data:** Also every two months, within the same window.

  </Note>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Legally required invoice content">
#### E-invoice
- **Invoice number & series:** A unique sequential number. If you are issuing the invoice as a customer, include the wording **“Autofacturation”** (self-billing).
- **Issue date**
- **Seller & customer details:**
  - Legal name and **SIREN** or **SIRET** number
- **Delivery address** (if different from the customer’s address)
- **Line details:**
  - For each good or service: precise description/quantity, unit price before VAT, and the VAT rate (or state VAT exemption and the legal basis)
- **Supply/completion/advance date** if different from the issue date
- **Special mentions** where relevant:
  - Legal basis for VAT exemption; travel agency scheme; margin scheme for second-hand/collectables, etc.
- **Payment terms (Code de commerce):**
  - Due date, early-payment discount terms, and late-payment penalties rate.
<Note>
For more information, see the official [government requirements for invoice content](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000046086694/?).
</Note>
#### E-reports
E-reports require the same information as e-invoices. When a **SIREN/SIRET** is not applicable, use an **intra-EU VAT number** or a **foreign identification number** instead.

#### Simplified e-invoice
When permitted, “low-value” invoices (≤ €150 ex-VAT) may omit certain items, and some sectors receive additional relaxations. A simplified invoice should include at least:
- **Issue date** and **unique sequential number**
- **Seller and customer identity** (name/address; SIREN/SIRET when applicable)
- **Delivery address** (if different from the customer’s address)
- **Quantity and precise description** of each item/service
- **Price & VAT:** unit price (ex-VAT), applicable VAT rate(s), net amount by rate, VAT amount by rate, and total VAT due
- **Supply/completion (or advance-payment) date** if it differs from the issue date
- **Scope indicator:** whether the invoice covers **goods**, **services**, or **both**
- **Special wording** when applicable, such as **“Autoliquidation”** (reverse charge) or **“Autofacturation”** (self-billing)

---

#### B2C

- **Daily aggregates** are transmitted rather than per-invoice data.  
- **No customer personal data** is sent.

**Per day, transmit:**
- Date and number of transactions
- For each category of operation (**goods** or **services**):
  - Total net (**HT**) for the day
  - **VAT amount**, with a breakdown by VAT rate if several rates apply

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Archival period">
  According to French commercial law, all e-invoices and e-reports must be kept for 10 years. 
  - Businesses must store documents in their original format and keep them in chronological order.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I e-report payment data?">
    Only when VAT is due on receipt of payment, such as for services under "cash VAT" (**TVA sur les encaissements**).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does this apply to foreign businesses without a Fixed Establishment (FE) in France?">
    E-invoicing does not apply. If the business is liable to French VAT, e-reporting applies to the relevant flows. E-reporting for reverse-charge VAT and intra EU-acquisitions is deferred until 1 September 2027.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I correct or cancel an e-invoice">
    You can't delete or retract an e-invoice. Issue a credit note or corrected invoice that references the original invoice.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to e-report imports?">
    Yes. If the supply is taxable under French reverse charge (i.e. VAT is paid on import), you must e-report the transaction.
