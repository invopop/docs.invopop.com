## Executive summary

import { PeppolIcon } from '/snippets/icons/app-peppol.jsx';
import { ChorusproIcon } from '/snippets/icons/fr-choruspro.jsx';

In France, e-invoicing runs on a hybrid model designed to ensure transparency, prevent fraud, and align with EU digitalization standards. The French model relies on a combination of private and state channels to transmit structured e-invoice data. Service providers known as "approved platforms" or **PA**s (Plateformes Agr√©√©es), link to a central state hub. To be compliant, each business will partner with a **PA** to issue, receive, and report structured invoice data to both the French tax authority (**DGFiP**) and to each buyer.

The new mandate is structured around two key functions: **e-invoicing** and **e-reporting**. 

- [B2B e-invoicing](#b2b-e-invoicing) becomes mandatory in phases from 1 September 2026, depending on company size.
- [E-reporting](#e-reporting) is required for B2C and B2B cross-border transactions.
- [B2G e-invoicing](#b2g-e-invoicing) will continue through Chorus Pro.
- All businesses must **receive** B2B e-invoices by 1 September 2026.

## E-invoicing in France

 An e-invoice contains the same information included in a regular invoice, but it is issued, transmitted, and stored in a structured data format like XML. France has been using e-invoices for the public sector since 2020, and as of September 2026, the e-invoicing requirement extends to domestic B2B transactions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2G">
    Businesses issue all e-invoices for B2G transactions through the Chorus Pro platform. Chorus Pro supports multiple integration modes (such as API, EDI/SFTP, AS/2 and PeSIT) so ERPs and accounting systems can automate submission and retrieval of invoices.

    A similar public-facing portal was also planned for B2B transactions, but the French government abandoned efforts in October 2024 due to development time and cost.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B2B">
   In France, domestic B2B invoices must be exchanged as structured electronic invoices over the Peppol network via certified approved platforms (**PA**). The PA validates the format and legal metadata, queries the state **Annuaire** (directory) to locate the buyer's receiving PA, and routes the invoice via the Peppol network. 

In parallel, the **PA** submits the invoic to the government **data concentrator**, where records the VAT of each transaction.

<Note>
  B2C and B2B cross-border transactions are e-reported
</Note>

## E-reporting

Involves sending invoice data to tax authorities in real-time or near real-time, typically as part of government initiatives to improve tax compliance and reduce VAT fraud. Invoice data will enable the **DGFiP** to pre-fill VAT declarations, increasing efficiency and reducing the administrative workload for businesses.

E-reporting in France is divided into two main flows: 

- **transaction data** ‚Äî the information of a sale or service, and 
- **payment data** ‚Äî the details of actual payments received, especially for services taxed on a cash basis.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="E-Reporting">

In the French model, e-reporting is required for VAT flows outside of the e-invoicing scope. These include payments, B2C sales, and cross-border B2B transactions.

Businesses use approved platforms to extract, validate, and transmit the mandated data to the tax authority according to their specific VAT reporting regime.

The following transactions are in scope:

- B2C transactions;
- Cross border B2B transactions (such as exports, intra-EU supplies, and acquisitions);
- Companies without a Fixed Establishment (**FE**) supplying to French consumers that are liable to French VAT; and
- Payment collections for **services** under **cash VAT** (TVA sur les encaissements).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legally required e-invoice content">

    #### E-invoice
    
  - **Invoice number & series:** A unique sequential number. If you are issuing the invoice as a customer, include the wording **‚ÄúAutofacturation‚Äù** (self-billing).
- **Issue date**
- **Seller & customer details:**
  - Legal name and **SIREN** or **SIRET** number

  - Legal basis for VAT exemption; travel agency scheme; margin scheme for second-hand/collectables, etc.
- **Payment terms (Code de commerce):**
  - Due date, early-payment discount terms, and late-payment penalties rate.

--- 

#### Simplified e-invoice
When permitted, ‚Äúlow-value‚Äù invoices (‚â§ ‚Ç¨150 ex-VAT) may omit certain items, and some sectors receive additional relaxations. A simplified invoice should include at least:
- **Issue date** and **unique sequential number**.
- **Seller and customer identity** (name/address; SIREN/SIRET when applicable).
- **Delivery address** (if different from the customer‚Äôs address).
- **Quantity and precise description** of each item/service.

- **Supply/completion (or advance-payment) date** if it differs from the issue date.
- **Scope indicator:** whether the invoice covers **goods**, **services**, or **both**.
- **Special wording** when applicable, such as **‚ÄúAutoliquidation‚Äù** (reverse charge) or **‚ÄúAutofacturation‚Äù** (self-billing).

  </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue e-invoices">
    You're not required to issue e-invoices for the following transactions:
    - B2C transactions; 
    - International B2B transactions;
    - Foreign operators with no Fixed Establishment (**FE**) in France; and
    - Transactions located outside of France for VAT purposes.
    <Note>
      All businesses operating in France must be able to **receive** e-invoices from 1 September 2026.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legally required e-report content">
    

**E-reports** require the same information as e-invoices. When a **SIREN/SIRET** is not applicable, use an **intra-EU VAT number** or a **foreign identification number** instead.

---

#### B2C

- **Daily aggregates** are transmitted rather than per-invoice data.  
- **No customer personal data** is sent.

**Per day, transmit:**
- Date and number of transactions.
- For each category of operation (**goods** or **services**):
  - Total net (**HT**) for the day.
  - **VAT amount**, with a breakdown by VAT rate if several rates apply.

On 1 September 2027, an additional five fields will be added. For more information, see the PDF on the [upcoming additional invoicing fields](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/media/1_metier/2_professionnel/EV/2_gestion/290_facturation_electronique/japprof_donnees-de-transactions-a-transmettre_vf.pdf).
  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to send e-reports">
    The following flows are out of scope
    - Imports of goods (unless subject to reverse charge);
    - B2C transactions operating under **EU OSS/IOSS** (the European One Stop Shop agreement);
    - Classified or national security contracts;
    - VAT-exempt transactions; and
    - Reverse charges when the buyer is liable to VAT.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Businesses with no Fixed-Establishment (FE) in France">
    Non-established businesses that operate in France do not have a SIREN or SIRET registration (a French VAT number). Therefore, non-established businesses can't receive or issue e-invoices through the French domestic network. 

Instead, they must e-report transactions and payments when they are liable for French VAT. These include:
- B2B transactions subject to French VAT;
- B2C transactions made in France; and
- Reverse-charge transactions when they remain partly VAT-liable.

Like all companies, non FE companies will need to partner with a PA to submit e-reports to the French tax authority.
  <Note>
E-reporting for reverse-charge VAT and intra EU-acquisitions is deferred until 1 September 2027.
  </Note>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="E-reporting cycles">
    Businesses must submit e-reports based on their existing VAT reporting schedule and the type of flow (**transactions** or **payments**).
    
#### Standard VAT regime (r√©gime r√©el normal mensuel)
- **Transaction data:** Reported **three times per month** (1‚Äì10, 11‚Äì20, and 21‚Äìend of month), within 10 days after each period.
- **Payment data:** Reported **monthly**, before the 10th of the following month.

#### Quarterly VAT regime (r√©gime r√©el normal trimestriel)
