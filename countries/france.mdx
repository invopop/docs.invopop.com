## Executive summary

France is rolling out mandatory e-invoicing for B2B and B2G transactions starting September 2026. All invoices for public sector (B2G) must already be sent through Chorus Pro. The country is transitioning to a centralized _Platform de Facturation Publique_ (PPF) model that will handle both e-invoicing and e-reporting.

* [B2G e-invoicing](#b2g-e-invoicing) has been mandatory since 2017 through ChorusPro and Peppol networks.
* [B2B e-invoicing](#b2b-e-invoicing) will become mandatory in phases starting September 2026, using the PPF platform.
* [E-reporting](#e-reporting) will be required alongside B2B e-invoicing using SAF-T format.
