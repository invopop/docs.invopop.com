Spain‚Äôs invoicing combines several overlapping systems:

* [VERI\*FACTU](#veri-factu-b2b) coming in 2026, required for self employed individuals and companies not covered by SII or TicketBAI. 
* [TicketBAI](#ticketbai-b2b%2C-b2g) required for issuers with tax obligations to the foral agencies of √Åvala, Biskaia and Gupizcoa. 
* [Facturae](#facturae-b2g) is required when businesses invoice Spanish public administrations (B2G), requiring invoices in XML format submitted through the **FACe** platform. 
* [SII](#sii-large-companies) mandates near-real-time reporting of invoice data to the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT)

Spain‚Äôs numerous invoicing and reporting systems stems from its decentralized fiscal structure, where regions like the Basque Country and Navarra manage their own tax authorities, alongside the national AEAT. Instead of a unified reform, Spain has evolved through incremental, purpose-specific initiatives. This layered approach reflects the country‚Äôs effort to balance regional autonomy, EU digitalization mandates, and the fight against tax fraud, but it has produced a complex patchwork of systems that coexist under overlapping jurisdictions.
