## Executive summary

In Spain, e-invoicing compliance is governed by a complex, regionally differentiated system designed to ensure transparency, prevent fraud, and align with EU digitalization standards. The country relies on multiple overlapping frameworks rather than a single unified system, reflecting both regional fiscal autonomy and incremental regulatory evolution.

[VERI\*FACTU](#veri-factu-b2b) will become mandatory for all B2B invoices starting January 1, 2026, except for companies already reporting via SII or TicketBAI. It requires digitally signed invoices, a QR code linking to AEAT verification. 

[TicketBAI](#ticketbai-b2b) applies in the Basque Country (√Ålava, Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa) and mandates certified software for digitally signed XML invoices, including QR codes and unique identifiers. 

[Facturae](#facturae-b2g) is required for B2G transactions, submitting XML invoices through the FACe platform, with VERI\*FACTU or TicketBAI still needed for business reporting. SII mandates near-real-time VAT reporting for large companies and select taxpayers.

[SII](#sii-large-companies) mandates near-real-time VAT reporting for large companies and select taxpayers.

This article also provides insight and further resources to understand [invoice regulation in Spain](#regluation) and a section of [frequently asked questions](#faq).

Invopop provides comprehensive coverage for Spanish invoicing through dedicated apps for VERI\*FACTU, TicketBAI, and Facturae, as well as integrations with platforms like Stripe, Chargebee, and Netsuite. This allows businesses to issue compliant invoices efficiently and manage white-label (B2B2B) operations.

## Invoicing in Spain

Spain‚Äôs invoicing combines several overlapping systems:

* [VERI\*FACTU](#veri-factu-b2b) enforced in 2026, required for self employed individuals and companies not covered by SII or TicketBAI. 
* [TicketBAI](#ticketbai-b2b%2C-b2g) required for issuers with tax obligations to the foral agencies of √Åvala, Biskaia and Gupizcoa. 
* [Facturae](#facturae-b2g) is required when businesses invoice Spanish public administrations (B2G), requiring invoices in XML format submitted through the **FACe** platform. 
* [SII](#sii-large-companies) mandates near-real-time reporting of invoice data to the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT)

Spain‚Äôs numerous invoicing and reporting systems stems from its decentralized fiscal structure, where regions like the Basque Country and Navarra manage their own tax authorities, alongside the national AEAT. Instead of a unified reform, Spain has evolved through incremental, purpose-specific initiatives. This layered approach reflects the country‚Äôs effort to balance regional autonomy, EU digitalization mandates, and the fight against tax fraud, but it has produced a complex patchwork of systems that coexist under overlapping jurisdictions.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue invoices">
        

    You don't have to issue invoices in the following scenarios:

    1. **Tax-exempt transactions** under [Article 20 of Law 37/1992](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1992-28740), **with some exceptions**: you still need to invoice for healthcare and hospital services, property sales, and goods exempt because you couldn't claim back the VAT you paid.

    2. **If you're under the [Equivalence Surcharge Regime](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/regimenes-tributacion-iva/regimen-especial-recargo-equivalencia/que-consiste-regimen-especial-recargo-equivalencia.html)** (a special VAT system). However, you must invoice for property sales that aren't tax-exempt (unless they're part of enforcing a guarantee).

    3. **If you're under the [Simplified Tax Regime](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/regimenes-tributacion-iva/regimen-simplificado.html)**, unless your tax is calculated based on how much you earn. You still need to invoice when selling fixed assets.

    4. **Other cases where the Tax Agency gives you permission** - they might waive the invoice requirement for certain industries or specific companies to keep business running smoothly.

    **Important:** Even in these four cases, you must issue an invoice if:
    - Your customer is a business/professional or a private individual who needs it for tax purposes
    - You're selling to another EU country
    - You're exporting goods
    - Your customer is a government body or a legal entity that isn't acting as a business

    5. **If you're in farming, livestock, or fishing under the special regime for those sectors**. You'll need to issue an "agricultural receipt" for compensation reimbursements if you bought from others in the same regime. You always need to invoice for property sales.

    6. **Financial and insurance transactions** - no matter who you're dealing with, even other businesses. **Exception:** you do need to invoice for taxable transactions (that aren't exempt) in mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands, or another EU country.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Archival period">

    **The archival period of invoices dictated by the AEAT is the following:**

    * **4 years:**
    This is the minimum general requirement for most invoices for tax purposes. Starting from the date for filing the corresponding tax return, according to General Tax Law 58/2003.

    * **6 years:**
    Commercial regulations require you to keep business documentation for 6 years, including invoices, correspondence, and supporting documents, under Article 30 of the Commercial Code.

    * **10 years (or longer):**
    Some special cases require longer retention periods:
       * **Capital assets/investments:** Must be kept for up to 10 years.
       * **Public grants:** Invoices related to EU public funding may need to be kept for up to 10 years, depending on European regulations.
       * **Legal disputes or inspections:** You may need to keep invoices longer if there's an ongoing lawsuit or tax inspection, such as in cases of tax fraud.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VERI*FACTU self certification process">
    There is no official certification for VERI\*FACTU from the AEAT (the Spanish tax agency). Instead, each developer, company, or provider that implements an invoicing software must provide an electronically signed declaration where they certify that their system meets all the requirements established in the regulations. This document is binding and must be kept available for the Tax Authority.

    The AEAT requires that this declaration be available and always visible within the system itself, and it must include certain control elements such as the installation number, issuer data, software version, and system ID.

    If you are a white label user of Invopop (you issue invoices in the name of third parties), you are required to display a link to this "declaraci√≥n responsable" in your software. Here is [the template from the AEAT](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/static_files/Sede/Tema/IVA/Verifactu/EjemplosDeclaracionResponsable(V0.5.1).pdf), and our own for your reference: [Declaraci√≥n responsable VERI\*FACTU - Invopop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IR2EuavoEi8E3hlAM4u-XTIFbalxxKzj/view). Some of our customers have asked us if it is necessary to mention Invopop in their _declaraci√≥n responable_. It is not required, but we appreciate it. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VERI*FACTU representation agreement">
    The Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) requires that companies formally authorize Invopop to issue invoices on their behalf. To comply with this regulation, the supplier‚Äôs legal representative must sign an agreement granting Invopop the necessary consent to generate and manage invoices in their name. This signed authorization ensures that all invoicing activities carried out by Invopop are legally valid and recognized by the AEAT.
    
    For this process, the supplier can sign the agreement PDF with a valid digital certificate, such as one issued by the FNMT, or a handwritten signature with a company stamp (sello de empresa), in which case the user must provide a valid ID such as DNI, NIE or passport. In the case of self-employed individuals (aut√≥nomos) a company stamp is not required.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do VERI*FACTU invoices need to be printed?">
    VERI\*FACTU invoices don't necessarily need to be printed because they are issued with electronic invoicing systems such as Invopop. Source: [AEAT FAQ](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/sistemas-informaticos-facturacion-verifactu/preguntas-frecuentes/posibilidad-remision-informacion-factura-parte-receptor.html?faqId=9e9e77fe52572910VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can we issue an VERI*FACTU invoice with an issue date in the past?">
    The AEAT is not strict about the validation, but it's best to keep your intentions clear. GOBL gives you alternative fields such as `op_date` and `value_date` to store details about your invoicing operation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does invopop support the white label (B2B2B) model?">
