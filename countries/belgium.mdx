## E-reporting

Belgium plans to adopt a Peppol-based five-corner model in 2028, integrating e-invoicing with near real-time e-reporting. This new system will replace the annual customer listing report and is designed to reduce the countryâ€™s VAT gap, currently estimated at around â‚¬4.8 billion per year. Businesses will be able to comply using either certified e-invoicing service providers or adapted ERP, invoicing, or accounting software, though participation through service providers will not be mandatory.
