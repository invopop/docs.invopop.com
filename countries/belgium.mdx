## Executive summary
In Belgium, e-invoicing runs on a decentralized model on the Peppol network. To align with EU digitalization standards, all domestic B2B transactions must be issued and received as structured e-invoices from 1 January 2026. B2G transactions have been sent as e-invoices since 1 March 2024. Belgian suppliers partner with providers called certified Peppol Access Points to send invoices to their buyers.

E-reporting (sending invoice data to the tax authority) is not part of the 2026 mandate, but is expected to come into force in 2028.

+ [B2B e-invoicing](#b2b-e-invoicing) is mandatory from 1 January 2026.
+ [B2G e-invoicing](#b2g-e-invoicing) is mandatory for contracts published after 1 March 2024.
+ All businesses must be able to receive B2B e-invoices by 1 January 2026 (even if they mainly serve consumers)

## E-invoicing in Belgium

An e-invoice contains the same information included in a regular invoice, but it is issued, transmitted, and stored in a structured data format like XML. From 1 January 2026, structured e-invoicing is compulsory for nearly all domestic B2B transactions between Belgian VAT-liable enterprises. 

[Hermes](https://bosa.belgium.be/fr/applications/hermes), the temporary web portal for e-invoicing will be decomissioned on 31 December 2025. Your Peppol Access Point will handle the magration from Hermes to the company's desired SMP (Service Metadata Publisher). The SMP functions as an endpoint registry that details each company's Peppol Participant ID, which documents you accpet, and Access Point URL.

## E-reporting (2028)

Belgium plans to adopt a Peppol-based five-corner model in 2028, integrating e-invoicing with near real-time e-reporting. This new system will replace the annual customer listing report and is designed to reduce the country’s VAT gap, currently estimated at around €4.8 billion per year. The measure is not enacted in law yet, so exact details are yet to be released.
