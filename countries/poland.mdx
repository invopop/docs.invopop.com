## Executive summary

Poland is moving to a centralized, clearance-based system called KSeF 2.0 that routes B2B invoices through a single state hub. Structured documents of XML in the FA(3) schema replace traditional PDFs. Each invoice is validated by the tax authority before it reaches the buyer; once cleared, it receives a unique KSeF identifier and is considered legally issued. The reform aims to curb VAT fraud, improve transparency, and standardize digital invoicing across the economy.

To improve adoption, KSeF offers multiple issuance channels including a web portal, a dedicated API for ERP integration, and an official mobile app. QR codes and a 24 hour offline modes have also been developed for easy verficiation and to maintain functionality during temporary network outages. 

- Every Polish business is required to **receive** e-invoices from 1 February 2026.
- The start date for issuing e-invoices is phased based on company size.
- B2C transactions are out of scope.
- Cross-border transactions (B2Bi) invoices are generated through KSeF.
- B2G e-invoicing continues through the PEF platform, which is now linked to KSeF.
- Penalties for non compliance are suspended until 31 December 2026.

### E-invoicing in Poland

An e-invoice contains the same information included in a regular invoice, but it is issued, transmitted, and stored in a structured data format like XML. Poland has used e-invoicing for the public sector since 2019, and as of February 2026, the requirement extends to domestic B2B transactions. 

Regardless of the sending method, all e-invoices will pass through the KSeF platform. For ad-hoc or lower volumes, businesses can use the web portal to enter invoices manually. In practice, most organisations access the KSeF platform with an accounting or ERP software using the dedicated API.

Businesses grant the required authorizations (with a KSeF token or certificate), and the system validates, transmits, and receives each e-invoice, ready to view in a company’s accounting system.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2G">
     B2G e-invoices have been issued through PEF, the public sector platform. As of the new mandate, PEF will synchronize with KSeF to apply the same validation sequences, so public entities can decide to use either portal.

  <Accordion title="B2B">
    For all B2B transactions, suppliers submit invoice data into an ERP using the KSeF API, or via the KSeF portal online, to convert the information into a structured FA(3) XML document. Before the e-invoice is sent to the buyer, the tax authority validates the file and assigns a unique KSeF ID.

    Once the e-invoice is validated, the buyer is able to view the invoice data in their accounts receivable. As evidence of a compliant e-invoice, the supplier has the option to  download an Official Receipt Certificate known as a UPO.

### International transactions (B2Bi)

For international transactions, the invoice is created and cleared in KSeF just like a domestic one. Once the invoice is validated, the tax data is recorded and it receives a KSeF ID to prove compliance. 

Because a foreign recipient without a Polish NIP (tax ID) cannot log in to KSeF, delivery takes place outside the platform. The commercial channels continue as before: via email, EDI attachment or paper. The document must include the KSeF references, in particular a QR code, so the buyer can scan the document and view a verifiable version online. 

### Regulation

The Ministry of Finance provides free tools to issue and receive structured invoices such as the Taxpayer Application, Mobile application and the e-Mikrofirma app. It publishes implementation manuals and the FA(3) information sheet, which explains formats, field semantics and integration in English.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legally required e-invoice content">
    An e-invoice contains the same business information as a traditional invoice, but must follow the FA(3) XML structure. 

    - Date and time (in the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format).
    - **Optional**: Name of the ICT software used by the taxpayer.
    - Supplier information (NIP).
    - Buyer information (NIP).
    - Third parties relating to the invoice if applicable (such as an e-invoicing provider).
    - Infomation regarding transaction terms.
    - KRS number: The invoice footer (“Stopka”) includes an optional “Rejestry” block for registry identifiers such as KRS and REGON.
    - **Optional:** From 1 February 2026 the optional “Zalacznik” element may be used where a transaction involves a complex set of data for units of measure, quantities, or net unit prices. Attachments are part of the structured file and are limited to data closely related to tax content. Prior notification (via e-Urząd Skarbowy) is required to enable attachments, and each attachment cannot exceed 3 MB. Non-tax materials (e.g., contracts or marketing content) are not allowed as invoice attachments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue e-invoices via KSeF">
    - B2C transactions 
    - Non-established businesses 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="KSeF Certificates">
    KSeF certificates are digital documents that authenticate a company in the KSeF portal. The designated individual of each company will apply for a **type 1 certificate** to use the KSeF API in an ERP or accounting software. Access is granted after the authorized person confirms their identity with a certified e-signature. KSeF certificates are available to download online from 1 November 2025 and will be added directly to the KSeF API from February 2026. 

    The KSeF **type 2 certificate** is the name given to the offline invoice that includes two QR codes for customers to scan on their phone: one QR code for the buyer to access the invoice online, another for the buyer to validate the supplier's identity. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B2C transactions (Fiscal cash registers)">
     

    B2C transactions are excluded from the e-invoicing mandate. The Polish tax authority already receives B2C sales data from online fiscal cash registers that continuously transmit receipts to the Central Repository of Cash Registers (CRK).

    Fiscal cash registers will not be able to send B2B e-invoices after 31 December 2026. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non established businesses (no FE)">
    A foreign entity is not obliged to issue invoices via KSeF if it has neither a registered office nor a fixed establishment in Poland, or if it has a fixed establishment in Poland that does not participate in the specific supply.

    Such entities may opt in and issue invoices through KSeF voluntarily; where the buyer lacks KSeF access, the seller provides the invoice by an agreed method and includes a QR code for verification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operational notes: QR codes, offline mode, and archiving.">
    - **QR codes:** KSeF provides QR codes to verify whether a document exists in the system and, for offline issuance, to authenticate the issuer. Offline invoices show two QR codes (“OFFLINE” and a certificate QR) until they are delivered to KSeF.
    - **Offline procedures:** In addition to real-time online clearance, KSeF supports: (1) offline24 (to issue now, upload by end of the next business day), (2) scheduled maintenance offline (to upload the day after maintenance ends), and (3) emergency mode (to upload within seven business days after an official outage).
    - **Retention:** Invoices accepted by KSeF are available in the system for 10 years; businesses do not need to operate a separate archive for originals.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add attachments to an e-invoice?">
    Yes. The structured “Zalacznik” is allowed for tax-relevant data on complex quantities and unit prices.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if KSeF is temporarily unavailable or I'm offline?">
    Use one of the defined offline modes. For “offline24,” issue the invoice with the special QR codes and transmit it to KSeF by the end of the next business day.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will B2C transactions need to be reported in KSeF?">
    No. B2C invoices in KSeF are optional. Receipts via cash registers continue, and receipts with buyer NIP up to PLN 450 remain recognized as simplified invoices through to 31 December 2026.
