## Executive summary

Poland is transitioning to KSeF 2.0: a centralized, clearance-based system that routes B2B invoices through a single state hub. E-invoices will replace traditional PDFs as structured documents of XML code, presented in the Polish FA(3) schema. The reform aims to curb VAT fraud, improve transparency, and standardize digital invoicing across the economy.

To improve adoption, KSeF offers multiple issuance channels including a web portal, a dedicated API for ERP integration, and an official mobile app. QR codes and a 24 hour offline modes have also been developed for easy verficiation and to maintain functionality during temporary network outages.

- Every Polish business is required to **receive** e-invoices from 1 February 2026.
- The start date for issuing e-invoices is phased based on company size.
- B2C transactions are out of scope.
- Cross-border transactions (B2Bi) invoices are generated through KSeF.
- B2G e-invoicing continues through the PEF platform, which is now linked to KSeF.
- Penalties for non compliance are suspended until 31 December 2026.

### E-invoicing in Poland

An e-invoice contains the same information included in a regular invoice, but it is issued, transmitted, and stored in a structured data format like XML. Poland has used e-invoicing for the public sector since 2019, and as of February 2026, the requirement extends to domestic B2B transactions.

Regardless of the sending method, all e-invoices will pass through the KSeF platform. For ad-hoc or lower volumes, businesses can use the web portal to enter invoices manually. In practice, most organisations access the KSeF platform with an accounting or ERP software using the dedicated API.

Businesses grant the required authorizations (with a KSeF token or certificate), and the system validates, transmits, and receives each e-invoice, ready to view in a company’s accounting system. Each invoice is validated by the tax authority before it reaches the buyer; once cleared, it receives a unique KSeF identifier and is considered legally issued. 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2G">
    B2G e-invoices have been issued through PEF, the public sector platform. As of the new mandate, PEF will synchronize with KSeF to apply the same validation sequences, so public entities can decide to use either portal.

  <Accordion title="B2B">
    For all B2B transactions, suppliers submit invoice data into an ERP using the KSeF API, or via the KSeF portal online, to convert the information into a structured FA(3) XML document. Before the e-invoice is sent to the buyer, the tax authority validates the file and assigns a unique KSeF ID.

    Once the e-invoice is validated, the buyer is able to view the invoice data in their accounts receivable. As evidence of a compliant e-invoice, the supplier has the option to  download an Official Receipt Certificate known as a UPO.

### International transactions (B2Bi)

For international transactions, the invoice is created and cleared in KSeF just like a domestic one. Once the invoice is validated, the tax data is recorded and it receives a KSeF ID to prove compliance.

Because a foreign recipient without a Polish NIP (tax ID) cannot log in to KSeF, delivery takes place outside the platform. The commercial channels continue as before: via email, EDI attachment or paper. The document must include the KSeF references, in particular a QR code, so the buyer can scan the document and view a verifiable version online.

### Regulation

The Ministry of Finance provides free tools to issue and receive structured invoices such as the Taxpayer Application, Mobile application and the e-Mikrofirma app. It publishes implementation manuals and the FA(3) information sheet, which explains formats, field semantics and integration in English.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legally required e-invoice content">
    An e-invoice contains the same business information as a traditional invoice, but must follow the FA(3) XML structure. 

    - Date and time (in the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format).
    - **Optional**: Name of the ICT software used by the taxpayer.
    - Supplier information (NIP).
    - Buyer information (NIP).
    - Third parties relating to the invoice if applicable (such as an e-invoicing provider).
    - Infomation regarding transaction terms.
    - KRS number: The invoice footer (“Stopka”) includes an optional “Rejestry” block for registry identifiers such as KRS and REGON.
    - **Optional:** From 1 February 2026 the optional “Zalacznik” element may be used where a transaction involves a complex set of data for units of measure, quantities, or net unit prices. Attachments are part of the structured file and are limited to data closely related to tax content. Prior notification (via e-Urząd Skarbowy) is required to enable attachments, and each attachment cannot exceed 3 MB. Non-tax materials (e.g., contracts or marketing content) are not allowed as invoice attachments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue e-invoices via KSeF">
    - B2C transactions
    - Non-established businesses

    <Note>
      For a full list of exemptions, see the "[scope](https://ksef.podatki.gov.pl/informacje-ogolne-ksef-20/zakres-obowiazkowego-ksef/)" page on the KSeF website.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="KSeF certificates">
    KSeF certificates are digital documents that authenticate a company in the KSeF portal.

    **Type 1 certificate**

    The designated individual of each company will apply for a type 1 certificate to use the KSeF API in an ERP or accounting software. Access is granted after the authorized person confirms their identity with a certified e-signature. KSeF certificates are available to download online from 1 November 2025 and will be added directly to the KSeF API from February 2026. 

    **Type 2 certificate** 

    For offline invoices, businesses send a type 2 certificate that includes two QR codes for customers to scan on their phone: one QR code for the buyer to access the invoice online, another to validate the supplier's identity. 

    <Note>
      For more information see the government FAQs section on [e-invoice QR codes](https://ksef.podatki.gov.pl/pytania-i-odpowiedzi-ksef-20/#:~:text=Co%20to%20jest%20kod%20QR%20i%20do%20czego%20s%C5%82u%C5%BCy%3F).
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B2C transactions (Fiscal cash registers)">
    B2C transactions are excluded from the e-invoicing mandate. The Polish tax authority already receives B2C sales data from online fiscal cash registers that continuously transmit receipts to the Central Repository of Cash Registers (CRK).

    For B2B transactions, receipts that include a buyer NIP below PLN 450 remain compliant as simplified invoices until 31 December 2026. Companies will need to submit these transactions via KSeF from 2027. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non established businesses (no FE)">
    A foreign entity is not required to issue invoices in KSeF if it has no registered office and no fixed establishment in Poland. It is also outside the mandate if it has a fixed establishment in Poland that does not participate in the specific supply. Such businesses still may opt to issue invoices through KSeF voluntarily. 

    A fixed establishment is defined as having "sufficient permanent presence with  human and technical resources". As the assessment is case-by-case, the Ministry of Finance has indicated it will publish additional explantations on the fixed establishment criteria.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operational notes: QR codes, offline mode, and archiving.">
    - **QR codes:** KSeF provides QR codes for B2Bi transactions to verify whether a document exists in the system and, for offline issuance, to authenticate the issuer. Offline invoices show two QR codes (“OFFLINE” and a certificate QR) until they are delivered to KSeF.
    - **Offline procedures:** In addition to real-time online clearance, KSeF supports: (1) offline24 (to issue now, upload by end of the next business day), (2) scheduled maintenance offline (to upload the day after maintenance ends), and (3) emergency mode (to upload within seven business days after an official outage).
    - **Retention:** Invoices accepted by KSeF are archived and available in the system for 10 years.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add attachments to an e-invoice?">
    Yes. The structured “Zalacznik” (attachment) is allowed for tax-relevant data on  quantities and unit prices. The feature is aimed at technical transactions in the energy sector, but any company can apply to use them.
