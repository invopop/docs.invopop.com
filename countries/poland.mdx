## Executive summary

Poland is shifting to a centralized, clearance-based e-invoicing system called KSeF, routing B2B invoices through one digital hub. Sellers can issue structured XML invoices through an onlinr portal, a dedicated API, or an official mobile app. Before the buyer ever sees it, each invoice is validated in KSeF by the tax authority; once cleared, it gets a unique KSeF ID and is legally issued. The aim is to reduce VAT fraud, increase transparency, and digitize the process of e-invoicing. The Polish tax authority have developed practical touches like QR codes and a 24-hour “offline” mode to improve usability.

- Every Polish business is required to receive e-invoices from 1 February 2026
- The start date for issuing e-invoices in phased based on company size.
- B2C transactions are out of scope
- Cross-border transactions (B2Bi) e-invoices are generated through KSeF.
- B2G e-invoicing continues through the PEF platform, which is now linked to KSeF.
- Penalties for non compliance are suspended until 31 December 2026

### E-invoicing in Poland

From 2026, domestic B2B invoices will be issued in a strucutred electronic format using the KSeF platform. For ad-hoc or lower volumes, businesses can use the web portal to enter invoices manually. In practice, most organisations access the KSeF platform in their accounting or ERP software using the dedicated API.

Businesses grant the required authorizations (with a KSeF token or certificate), and the system validates, transmits, and receives each e-invoice, ready to view in a company’s accounting system.

B2G transactions have used e-invoices since 2019, and will not be affected by the new mandate.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2G">
    All B2G e-invoices have previously been sent through PEF, the public sector platform. Now, PEF will synchronize with KSeF to apply the same validation sequences, meaning that public entities can decide to use either portal.

  <Accordion title="B2B">
    For all B2B transactions, suppliers submit invoice data into an ERP (using the KSeF API) or via the KSeF portal, which converts the information into a structured FA(3) XML document. Before the e-invoice is sent to the buyer, the tax authority validates the file and assigns a unique KSeF ID.

    Once the e-invoice is validated, the buyer is able to retrieve the data in their accounts receivable. To confirm compliance, the supplier can download a UPO to prove the e-invoice has been received and  certified by the tax authority.

### International transactions (B2Bi)

Poland does not introduce a separate e-reporting flow alongside e-invoicing. Domestic B2C remains outside KSeF and continues through online fiscal cash registers sending data to the CRK repository. Cross-border B2B must be issued via KSeF (data reported to tax) and delivered to the foreign buyer outside KSeF (visualization/PDF with KSeF references).

### Regulation

The Ministry of Finance provides free tools to issue and receive structured invoices such as the Taxpayer Application, Mobile application and the e-Mikrofirma app. It publishes implementation manuals and the FA(3) information sheet, which explains formats, field semantics and integration in English.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="legally required e-invoice content">
    An e-invoice contains the same business information as a traditional invoice, but must follow the FA(3) XML structure. 

    - Date and time (in the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format).
    - \*\*Optional: \*\*Name of the ICT system used by the taxpayer.
    - Supplier information (NIP).
    - Buyer information (NIP).
    - Third parties relating to the invoice if applicable (such as an e-invoicing provider).
    - Infomation regarding transaction terms.
    - KRS number: The invoice footer (“Stopka”) includes an optional “Rejestry” block for registry identifiers such as KRS and REGON.
    - **Optional:** From 1 February 2026 the optional “Zalacznik” element may be used where a transaction involves a complex set of data for units of measure, quantities, or net unit prices. Attachments are part of the structured file and are limited to data closely related to tax content. Prior notification (via e-Urząd Skarbowy) is required to enable attachments, and each attachment cannot exceed 3 MB. Non-tax materials (e.g., contracts or marketing content) are not allowed as invoice attachments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue e-invoices via KSeF">
    - B2C transactions (recepits continue via cash registers until 2027)
    - asdasdadsdasfNon-established businesses (when their transactions are not liable for VAT)ds
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="KSeF Certificates">
    KSeF certificates are official credentials used to authenticate with the National e-Invoicing System and to mark invoices issued in special modes (offline24, planned maintenance, or emergency). From 1 February 2026, certificates are required for these flows to confirm the issuer’s identity when an invoice is delivered outside KSeF (with verification via QR). Certificates are requested and managed in the Certificates & Permissions Module (MCU). 

    They do not carry access rights themselves; permissions are granted and revoked separately in KSeF. There are two types, authentication and offline, each typically valid for up to two years. Certificates can be used alongside API tokens through 31 December 2026; from 1 January 2027, certificates become the standard. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B2C transactions (Fiscal cash registers)">
    Until the end of 2026, invoices can be issued using fiscal cash registers, without the need to use KSeF. From 2027, if an invoice is issued for a transaction recorded using an online cash register, it will have to be issued in KSeF if it concerns sales to a taxpayer. Invoices for individuals (consumers who do not run a business) do not have to be issued in KSeF - they can be issued in KSeF optionally."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non established businesses (no FE)">
    A foreign entity is not obliged to issue invoices via KSeF if it has neither a registered office nor a fixed establishment in Poland, or if it has a fixed establishment in Poland that does not participate in the specific supply.

    Such entities may opt in and issue invoices through KSeF voluntarily; where the buyer lacks KSeF access, the seller provides the invoice by an agreed method and includes a QR code for verification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operational notes: QR codes, offline mode, and archiving.">
    - **QR codes:** KSeF provides QR codes to verify whether a document exists in the system and, for offline issuance, to authenticate the issuer. Offline invoices show two QR codes (“OFFLINE” and a certificate QR) until they are delivered to KSeF.
    - **Offline procedures:** In addition to real-time online clearance, KSeF supports: (1) offline24 (to issue now, upload by end of the next business day), (2) scheduled maintenance offline (to upload the day after maintenance ends), and (3) emergency mode (to upload within seven business days after an official outage).
    - **Retention:** Invoices accepted by KSeF are available in the system for 10 years; businesses do not need to operate a separate archive for originals.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add attachments to an e-invoice?">
    Yes. The structured “Zalacznik” is allowed for tax-relevant data on complex quantities and unit prices.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if KSeF is temporarily unavailable or I'm offline?">
    Use one of the defined offline modes. For “offline24,” issue the invoice with the special QR codes and transmit it to KSeF by the end of the next business day.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will B2C transactions need to be reported in KSeF?">
    No. B2C invoices in KSeF are optional. Receipts via cash registers continue, and receipts with buyer NIP up to PLN 450 remain recognized as simplified invoices through to 31 December 2026.
