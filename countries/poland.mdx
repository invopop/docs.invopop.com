## Executive summary

Poland is moving to a **centralized clearance** model for domestic e-invoicing called KSeF (Krajowy System e-Faktur). Sellers submit structured XML e-invoices to KSeF for validation; once cleared, the invoice receives a unique KSeF ID and is considered legally issued and made available to the buyer. The reform targets VAT fraud reduction and end-to-end digitalization, introducing features such as QR codes and a contigency "offline24" mode.
+ Every Polish business is required to receive e-invoices from 1 February 2026
+ The start date for issuing e-invoices in phased based on company size.
+ B2C transactions are out of scope
+ Cross-border transactions (B2Bi) e-invoices are generated through KSeF.
+ B2G e-invoicing continues through the PEF platform, which is now linked to KSeF.
+ Penalties for non compliance are suspended until 31 December 2026

###  E-invoicing in Poland 

An e-invoice is a structured XML document issued and cleared through KSeF. From 1 Feb 2026, the binding schema is FA(3) for all structured invoices (including corrections and finals). After clearance, the invoice gets a unique KSeF ID and is archived centrally. A UPO (official receipt confirmation) is available to the issuer in the KSeF tools.

  <Accordion title="B2B">
    Poland uses a centralized clearance system for B2B e-invoicing. Sellers submit FA(3) XML invoices from their ERP or the KSeF portal. The tax authority validates each file, assigns a unique KSeF number, and makes the invoice available to the buyer. The invoice is legally received when it appears in KSeF. If a PDF or printout is sent outside the system, it must display the KSeF number and a QR code. Cleared invoices are stored in KSeF for ten years.

### E-reporting
Poland does not introduce a separate e-reporting flow alongside e-invoicing. Domestic B2C remains outside KSeF and continues through online fiscal cash registers sending data to the CRK repository. Cross-border B2B must be issued via KSeF (data reported to tax) and delivered to the foreign buyer outside KSeF (visualization/PDF with KSeF references). 

### Regulation
The Polish Ministry of Finance and National Revenue Administration (KAS) operate KSeF and the CRK repository.
