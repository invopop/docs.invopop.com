## Invoicing in Portugal

Portugal's invoicing combines two responsibilities for B2B invoicing:

* [ACTUD](#veri-factu-b2b) enforced in 2026, required for self employed individuals and companies not covered by SII or TicketBAI. 
* [SAFT-PT](#ticketbai-b2b%2C-b2g) monthly compilation of all invoices issued.


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ACTUD/QR">
    <Warning>
    VERI\*FACTU will be mandatory for companies from January 1st, 2026. The rest of tax payers from 1 July 2026. Companies reporting with SII or TicketBAI are exempt from reporting with VERI\*FACTU.
    </Warning>

    Spain’s upcoming e-reporting and fiscalization regulation requiring businesses to use approved software that records and digitally signs each invoice to ensure transparency and prevent fraud. The format requires a QR code which links to the online verification service of the AEAT.

## E-reporting

Involves sending invoice data to tax authorities in real-time or near real-time, typically as part of government initiatives to improve tax compliance and reduce VAT fraud.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SII (large companies)">
    SII allows AEAT to receive VAT-related information almost in real time. It aims to reduce errors in VAT declarations, improve fraud detection, and streamline administrative reporting. Obligatory for large companies with an annual turnover > €6 million and optional for smaller companies that want faster reconciliation with the Tax Agency.

<AccordionGroup>

     * It's a tax-exempt sale of goods between EU countries.
     * The customer is responsible for paying the tax on the transaction.

In certain situations it may authorize that simplified invoices that don't include some of the above requirements. These authorizations must be properly published.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When you're not required to issue invoices">
        

    You don't have to issue invoices in the following scenarios:

    1. **Tax-exempt transactions** under [Article 20 of Law 37/1992](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1992-28740), **with some exceptions**: you still need to invoice for healthcare and hospital services, property sales, and goods exempt because you couldn't claim back the VAT you paid.

    2. **If you're under the [Equivalence Surcharge Regime](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/regimenes-tributacion-iva/regimen-especial-recargo-equivalencia/que-consiste-regimen-especial-recargo-equivalencia.html)** (a special VAT system). However, you must invoice for property sales that aren't tax-exempt (unless they're part of enforcing a guarantee).

    3. **If you're under the [Simplified Tax Regime](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/regimenes-tributacion-iva/regimen-simplificado.html)**, unless your tax is calculated based on how much you earn. You still need to invoice when selling fixed assets.

    4. **Other cases where the Tax Agency gives you permission** - they might waive the invoice requirement for certain industries or specific companies to keep business running smoothly.

    **Important:** Even in these four cases, you must issue an invoice if:
    - Your customer is a business/professional or a private individual who needs it for tax purposes
    - You're selling to another EU country
    - You're exporting goods
    - Your customer is a government body or a legal entity that isn't acting as a business

    5. **If you're in farming, livestock, or fishing under the special regime for those sectors**. You'll need to issue an "agricultural receipt" for compensation reimbursements if you bought from others in the same regime. You always need to invoice for property sales.

    6. **Financial and insurance transactions** - no matter who you're dealing with, even other businesses. **Exception:** you do need to invoice for taxable transactions (that aren't exempt) in mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands, or another EU country.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Archival period">

    **The archival period of invoices dictated by the AEAT is the following:**

    * **4 years:**
    This is the minimum general requirement for most invoices for tax purposes. Starting from the date for filing the corresponding tax return, according to General Tax Law 58/2003.

    * **6 years:**
    Commercial regulations require you to keep business documentation for 6 years, including invoices, correspondence, and supporting documents, under Article 30 of the Commercial Code.

    * **10 years (or longer):**
    Some special cases require longer retention periods:
       * **Capital assets/investments:** Must be kept for up to 10 years.
       * **Public grants:** Invoices related to EU public funding may need to be kept for up to 10 years, depending on European regulations.
       * **Legal disputes or inspections:** You may need to keep invoices longer if there's an ongoing lawsuit or tax inspection, such as in cases of tax fraud.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VERI*FACTU self certification process">
    There is no official certification for VERI\*FACTU from the AEAT (the Spanish tax agency). Instead, each developer, company, or provider that implements an invoicing software must provide an electronically signed declaration where they certify that their system meets all the requirements established in the regulations. This document is binding and must be kept available for the Tax Authority.

    The AEAT requires that this declaration be available and always visible within the system itself, and it must include certain control elements such as the installation number, issuer data, software version, and system ID.

    If you are a white label user of Invopop (you issue invoices in the name of third parties), you are required to display a link to this "declaración responsable" in your software. Here is [the template from the AEAT](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/static_files/Sede/Tema/IVA/Verifactu/EjemplosDeclaracionResponsable(V0.5.1).pdf), and our own for your reference: [Declaración responsable VERI\*FACTU - Invopop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IR2EuavoEi8E3hlAM4u-XTIFbalxxKzj/view). Some of our customers have asked us if it is necessary to mention Invopop in their _declaración responable_. It is not required, but we appreciate it. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VERI*FACTU representation agreement">
    The Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) requires that companies formally authorize Invopop to issue invoices on their behalf. To comply with this regulation, the supplier’s legal representative must sign an agreement granting Invopop the necessary consent to generate and manage invoices in their name. This signed authorization ensures that all invoicing activities carried out by Invopop are legally valid and recognized by the AEAT.
    
    For this process, the supplier can sign the agreement PDF with a valid digital certificate, such as one issued by the FNMT, or a handwritten signature with a company stamp (sello de empresa), in which case the user must provide a valid ID such as DNI, NIE or passport. In the case of self-employed individuals (autónomos) a company stamp is not required.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do VERI*FACTU invoices need to be printed?">
    VERI\*FACTU invoices don't necessarily need to be printed because they are issued with electronic invoicing systems such as Invopop. Source: [AEAT FAQ](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/sistemas-informaticos-facturacion-verifactu/preguntas-frecuentes/posibilidad-remision-informacion-factura-parte-receptor.html?faqId=9e9e77fe52572910VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can we issue an VERI*FACTU invoice with an issue date in the past?">
    The AEAT is not strict about the validation, but it's best to keep your intentions clear. GOBL gives you alternative fields such as `op_date` and `value_date` to store details about your invoicing operation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does invopop support the white label (B2B2B) model in VERI*FACTU?">
    Yes, we are especially powerful and simple for this. Read more in our [white label use case](/use-cases/white-label).
