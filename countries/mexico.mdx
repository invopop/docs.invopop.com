## Executive summary

Mexico operates a modern electronic invoicing regime. The **CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)** system, managed by the **Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria (SAT)**, has made e-invoicing mandatory for all taxpayers‚Äîcovering B2B, B2C, and B2G transactions. Every invoice must be issued in XML format, digitally signed, and validated in real time by an authorized certification provider (**PAC**), ensuring immediate tax traceability.

The current standard, **CFDI 4.0**, introduced in 2022, adds strict identity and address validation requirements and enhances data consistency across the system. This clearance model gives SAT near-real-time visibility into the entire economy and serves as a global reference for digital fiscal control.

Invopop integrates directly with local PAC partners and the SAT, allowing businesses to issue fully compliant CFDIs directly from platforms like **Stripe**, **Chargebee**, and **Netsuite**, simplifying Mexico‚Äôs complex regulatory demands through a single, unified API.

## Invoicing in Mexico


**Electronic invoicing in Mexico** is fully mandatory and governed by the **Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria (SAT)** through the **CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)** system.

All taxpayers‚Äîindividuals and companies‚Äîmust issue invoices in **XML format**, digitally signed and validated in real time by an authorised certification provider (**PAC**). Only stamped invoices are legally valid for tax and accounting purposes.

The current standard, **CFDI 4.0**, enforces stricter data validation (tax regime, postal code, exact legal name) and became mandatory in 2022. Invoices must be archived for at least five years.

This clearance model gives SAT near-real-time visibility of all transactions, making Mexico one of the most advanced and mature e-invoicing systems globally. Businesses must ensure accurate data, compliant ERP integration, and proper archiving to avoid fines or rejected invoices.

## E-reporting

Involves sending invoice data to tax authorities in real-time or near real-time, typically as part of government initiatives to improve tax compliance and reduce VAT fraud.

Mexico does not have a separate ‚Äúe-reporting directive‚Äù, because the CFDI system is itself an e-invoicing + e-reporting regime. It ensures continuous transaction-level data flow to the tax authority, far stricter and more integrated than the EU‚Äôs periodic e-reporting proposals.
