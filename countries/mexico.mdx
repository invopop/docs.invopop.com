## Mexico

The CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet) is the standardized electronic invoicing format in Mexico, managed by the country’s tax authority, the SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria). This system ensures that all fiscal documents are digitally generated, validated, and reported to SAT in compliance with national tax laws.

## E-reporting

In Mexico, e-reporting is fully integrated into the e-invoicing system. Every issued invoice is reported to the SAT in real time through authorized certification providers (PACs). These intermediaries validate the XML structure, apply a digital signature, and forward the document to SAT, effectively making each invoice a live tax report. As a result, SAT receives a continuous feed of all business transactions—sales, payments, credit notes, payroll, and even goods transport—without separate periodic submissions. This model gives SAT near-total visibility over the economy, allowing automated VAT reconciliation, audit-by-data, and pre-filled tax returns.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Archival period">

  According to Article 30 of the Federal Tax Code, businesses in Mexico must keep all their accounting records, including electronic invoices, for five years. This period is counted as follows:

  * It starts from the date the relevant tax return was filed, or should have been filed.
  * For accounting records that cover a longer period, the five years start from the tax return of the last fiscal year covered by those records.
  * If the records were part of a legal case or appeal, the period begins on the date the final decision is issued.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a PAC?">
  In the Mexican invoicing system, a PAC is a “Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación” or Authorized Certification Provider. The SAT requires that all electronic invoices (CFDIs) be validated and certified. A PAC is an officially authorized private company that handles this certification process. They verify that the invoice complies with SAT rules, assign the digital seal, and send it back to the issuer.
  Essentially, a PAC acts as a trusted intermediary between businesses and the tax authority, ensuring that electronic invoices are legally recognized and properly formatted. Invopop uses [SW Sapien](https://smarterweb.com.mx), an Authorised Certification Provider (PAC), to sign and stamp CFDI documents for the Mexican tax authority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VERI*FACTU representation agreement">
    The Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) requires that companies formally authorize Invopop to issue invoices on their behalf. To comply with this regulation, the supplier’s legal representative must sign an agreement granting Invopop the necessary consent to generate and manage invoices in their name. This signed authorization ensures that all invoicing activities carried out by Invopop are legally valid and recognized by the AEAT.
    
    For this process, the supplier can sign the agreement PDF with a valid digital certificate, such as one issued by the FNMT, or a handwritten signature with a company stamp (sello de empresa), in which case the user must provide a valid ID such as DNI, NIE or passport. In the case of self-employed individuals (autónomos) a company stamp is not required.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do VERI*FACTU invoices need to be printed?">
    VERI\*FACTU invoices don't necessarily need to be printed because they are issued with electronic invoicing systems such as Invopop. Source: [AEAT FAQ](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/sistemas-informaticos-facturacion-verifactu/preguntas-frecuentes/posibilidad-remision-informacion-factura-parte-receptor.html?faqId=9e9e77fe52572910VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can we issue an VERI*FACTU invoice with an issue date in the past?">
    The AEAT is not strict about the validation, but it's best to keep your intentions clear. GOBL gives you alternative fields such as `op_date` and `value_date` to store details about your invoicing operation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does invopop support the white label (B2B2B) model in VERI*FACTU?">
    Yes, we are especially powerful and simple for this. Read more in our [white label use case](/use-cases/white-label).
