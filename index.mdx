Think of **Invopop** as a translation engine for business documents. Our [API](/api-ref/introduction) accepts invoices in a single, universal format [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) and converts them into the local format, forwarding them to the customer and tax authorities as needed. We also support receiving incoming invoices from local networks or providers such as Peppol, converting them to the same universal format.

Invopop doesn't just handle invoices—we support payment receipts, purchase orders, delivery notes, and more. All documents use [GOBL (Go Business Language)](https://gobl.org/), our open-source universal format. This means you only need to integrate once with Invopop-we manage the complexity of localization.
