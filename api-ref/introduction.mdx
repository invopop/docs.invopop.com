The Invopop API is split into multiple services. Each is effectively a namespace
for the different problem domain that we're trying to provide solutions for.

The current list of key services is:

- **Silo** `/silo/v1` · Data store for GOBL documents and their attachments. The silo is also responsible for validating incoming data with the GOBL libraries, managing versions, and state control.
- **Transform** `/transform/v1` · Responsible for storing workflow definitions and executing "jobs".
- **Sequences** `/sequences/v1` · Provides reliable and scalable support for generating sequential codes typically added to invoices.
- **Access** `/access/v1` · Provides access to workspaces and additional functionality required by Applications for enrollment handling.
- **Utils** `/utils/v1` · Is used for testing the connection and access credentials.

The details for each service are described in the following sections.
