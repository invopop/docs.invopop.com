The Invopop API is split into multiple services. Each is effectively a namespace
for the different problem domain that we're trying to provide solutions for.

The current list of key services is:

- [Silo](/api-ref/silo) - `/silo/v1` - Data store for GOBL documents and their attachments. The silo is also responsible for validating incoming data with the GOBL libraries, managing versions, and state control.
- [Transform](/api-ref/transform) - `/transform/v1` - Responsible for storing workflow definitions and executing "jobs".
- [Sequences](/api-ref/sequences) - `/sequences/v1` - Provides reliable and scalable support for generating sequential codes typically added to invoices.
- [Access](/api-ref/access) - `/access/v1` - Provides access to workspaces and additional functionality required by Applications for enrollment handling.
- [Utils](/api-ref/utils/ping) - `/utils/v1` - Is used for testing the conection and access credentials.

The details for each service are described in the following sections.
