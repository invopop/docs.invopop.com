Invopop API Keys are generated using the [Console](https://console.invopop.com). Enter "Configuration", then "API Keys", and tap "New API Key". Enter some reference details and click "Save". You'll be presented with a screen showing a new token. You **must** copy and paste this token, as we do not store it anywhere. If you loose it, you'll need to create a
new API key.

<Tip>
  Invopop uses JSON Web Tokens. If you're interested in seeing the contents,
  head over to [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) and paste you're token to see what's
  inside.
</Tip>

Tokens must be included in the `Authorization` HTTP header in all requests as a type `Bearer`.

Test everything is working correctly using the [ping](/api-ref/utils/ping)
endpoint and curl:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" https://api.invopop.com/utils/v1/ping

{"ping":"pong"}
```
