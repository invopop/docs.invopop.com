While we've tried to make as much of the Invopop API as intuitive as possible,
this brief glossary should help clarify what we mean when using certain words
about the platform.

| Term      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Key   | This is the code used to authenticate requests to the Invopop API. These should be kept in a secure and secret location. Read more in our [Authentication Guide](/guides/features/authentication).                                                                                                                                                       |
| App       | Applications (apps) add services and functionality to Invopop workspaces. Once configured, an app can enable actions to be added in workflows.                                                       |
| Customer  | Customers are `org.Party` objects containing details about who should receive the document.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Document  | In a general context this refers to PDFs or JSON documents. This is also the name of the property inside GOBL Envelopes that uses a [schema.Object](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/schema/object) to wrap around the payload. 
| Entry Collection | Group of related silo entries                                              |
| Envelope  | More accurately, a "GOBL Envelope" is a wrapper around a payload that adds a header and set of digital signatures. See the [GOBL Envelope](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/envelope) for more details.                                                                            |
| GOBL      | Stands for "Go Business Language" and is the library and schema we created in order to simplify the creation of electronic invoices and other structured documents using JSON as the primary representation format. For more details, so the [gobl.org](https://gobl.org) site. |
| Intent    | These represent the link between a job and a specific connector that needs to be executed. They contain a list of events tracking the execution process.                                                                                                                        |
| Job       | A job represents the link between an Envelope and a Workflow. It contains an Intent for each of the integrations that have been executed.                                                                                                                                       |
| Object    | In the context of a GOBL document, this refers to a model defined in the GOBL schema that can be used standalone or in the `doc` property of an envelope.
| Organization | Represents your company or team. It groups users and workspaces, manages member permissions, and handles billing and account settings.|
| Payload   | The main data content of an API request or response.
| Position  | Every user has a "position" inside a company. |
| Provider  | Not normally referred to by the API, but worth mentioning due to their importance to Invopop. A Provider is the name we've given to the service that is used to execute a task. Some providers are global, most are region specific.                                            |
| Regime    | Otherwise known as the "tax regime" is typically the country or potentially state where a company is fiscally registered. It determines the rules that will be applied to a GOBL document, and which providers and thus tasks will be available for the company.                |
| Sequence  | Refers to the service that is responsible for managing sequences, sequential codes that are guaranteed to be ordered and suitable to be included in legal documents.                                                                                                            |
| Series    | Part of the sequence service, a series contains a definition that defines prefixes, indexes, and suffixes used to generate sequential codes.                                                                                                                                    |
| Silo      | Our name for the GOBL Envelope storage service. (We like this name because it's short). It's also responsible for persisting attachments with envelopes, such as PDFs generated by task.
| Silo Entry | A document stored in the Invopop Silo service. |
| Spool | Temporary file storage service for processing documents. |
| Step      | A single step inside a workflow that performs an action on the GOBL document being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Supplier  | A supplier is an `org.Party` instance of a legal entity or person on behalf of whom invoices should be issued.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Transform | This service is responsible for executing jobs using the defined workflow and it's integrations. Sometimes this will be called the "Transform Engine".                                                                                                                          |
| User      | Used to grant access to a company, it'll link an email address with a person. A user may have multiple positions at different companies.                                                                                                                                        |
| UUID      | Universally Unique Identifier. Value that is guaranteed to be unique across all devices and systems. Used to reliably identify fields and allows the relation between documents.                                                                                                |
| Workflow  | A key component of the Transform engine. The Workflow defines a set of integrations that should be executed by a job.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Workspace | Dedicated space where you organize and isolate your workflows, documents, and API keys. Information in a workspace can't be accessed or shared across other workspaces. Each Organization can have multiple workspaces to separate data by company, country, or  use case.|
