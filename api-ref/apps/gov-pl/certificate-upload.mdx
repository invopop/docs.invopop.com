The certificate, private key, and password must be generated client-side following the standard KSeF certificate generation process:
1. Log into the [KSeF Portal](https://ksef.mf.gov.pl/) (production) or [KSeF Demo Portal](https://ap-demo.ksef.mf.gov.pl/web/) (demo)
2. Generate the certificate with authentication enabled for KSeF
3. Download the certificate file and private key file
4. Save the password used during generation

All three components are required for authentication with the KSeF system. The uploaded credentials are securely stored and used to sign and submit invoices on behalf of the registered party.

<Note>
  This endpoint should only be used after running the party registration workflow. The entry must be in a state where it is waiting for certificate upload.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The certificate and private key must be base64-encoded. Ensure the certificate start date is not in the future, and that the certificate and private key match.
</Warning>
