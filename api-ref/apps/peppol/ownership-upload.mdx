This endpoint allows you to upload a proof of ownership PDF document for Peppol registration. Upload it to Invopop so that it will be stored as an attachment to the silo entry. This document serves as verification of company ownership and is required for Peppol participant registration compliance.

The uploaded PDF will be reviewed by Invopop as part of the validation process, which can take up to 72 hours. The approval status can be monitored through the silo entry's metadata.
