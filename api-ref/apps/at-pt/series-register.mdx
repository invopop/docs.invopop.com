This endpoint registers a new series for the supplier. The series will be validated and registered with the Portuguese Tax Authority, and a validation code (used to generate ATCUD codes) will be returned.

For a detailed explanation of the `type` field (`N`, `F`, `R`) and other Portugal-specific series requirements, see the [Series Management](/guides/pt-at#series-management) section of the AT Portugal Guide.
