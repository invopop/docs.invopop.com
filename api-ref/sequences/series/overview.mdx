## Model

A "Series" object contains the following fields:

| Property      | Type            | Description                                                                                           |

| suffix        | string          | Text added after the series' number.                                                                  |
| last_index    | integer         | The series' last assigned number, zero, or the defined first index if no entries have been added yet. |
| last_entry_id | uuid            | ID of the entry last inserted for this series.                                                        |
| sigs          | array of string | If the series was created with any signatures, they'll be here.                                       |
| created_at    | date-time       | Timestamp of the series' creation.                                                                    |
| updated_at    | data-time       | Timestamp of the last update.                                                                         |

A series object may look like:

```json
{
  "id": "835bb1ca-e7c4-41e6-9e88-464de54cc08e",
  "name": "Testing",
  "prefix": "TEST1",
  "padding": 5,
  "suffix": "-2022",
  "last_index": 1001,
  "last_entry_id": "78b53c40-9b40-11ec-9298-665181255c0a",
  "created_at": "2022-03-03T22:18:50Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-03-03T22:18:50Z"
}
```

The last entry added to that sequence would have generated the code:
`TEST101001-2022`.
