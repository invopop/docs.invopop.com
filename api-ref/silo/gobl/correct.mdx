title: "Correct GOBL Envelope"
openapi: "POST /silo/v1/gobl/correct"
---

Use this endpoint to help determine the options for correcting [GOBL](https://docs.gobl.org) documents and then perform the correction itself.

This is useful when you need to issue credit notes or corrective versions of a previously issued invoice and need clarity on the local options.

All requests to the endpoint require a **[GOBL Envelope](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/envelope)**, and cannot be used with a [GOBL Invoice](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice) or other GOBL object. This is because some tax regimes require specific details from the previous document's headers, like a special identification code.

Use the `show_options` flag to return a JSON Schema of the options that can be used with the provided document.

Once the options are clear, send in a new request with the `options` data to get an example corrected [GOBL Envelope](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/envelope). The same options data can be used with the [silo create entry endpoint](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-post) and the `correct` property.
