title: "Correct GOBL Envelope"
openapi: "POST /silo/v1/gobl/correct"
---

Use this endpoint to help determine the options for correcting GOBL documents and then perform the correction itself.

This is useful when you need to issue credit notes or corrective versions of a previously issued invoice and need clarity on the local options.

All requests to the endpoint require a **GOBL Envelope**, and cannot be used with a GOBL Invoice or other GOBL object. This is because some tax regimes require specific details from the previous document's headers, like a special identification code.

Use the `show_options` flag to return a JSON Schema of the options that can be used with the provided document.

Once the options are clear, send in a new request with the `options` data to get an example corrected GOBL Envelope. The same options data can be used with the [silo create entry endpoint](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-post) and the `correct` property.
