Use this endpoint to execute a workflow with a specific time-based UUID, v7 or v1.

If the `key` property is provided, it will be checked for uniqueness within the current workspace and are valid for up to 2 years.

To execute a job, provide one of the following fields:

- `silo_entry_id` - preferred, the UUID of the silo entry to process with the workflow.
- `data` - raw GOBL data of the job, which will be persisted to the silo before processing.
- `args` - a data object containing application-specific data used in the workflow's initial actions to prepare and upload a silo entry.

The `wait` query parameter can cause the server to block the incoming HTTP request and wait for up to the specified number of seconds. Typically, a workflow executes in under a second, but some actions may take longer. We recommend using the `wait` query parameter only in sandbox or testing environments, as workflows can sometimes exceed expected durations due to network failures or other temporary issues.

Arguments (`args`) are composed of string key-value pairs tailored to specific applications. Binary data can be included using Data URIs (`data:`), which must specify the content type and include a `name` parameter. For example: `data:text/plain;name=example.txt;base64,ZGF0YQ==`. Any data provided via this method will be automatically uploaded to the Silo Spool service and will remain accessible only through tokens issued for the corresponding workspace.
